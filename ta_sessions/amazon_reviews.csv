However, there was also a somewhat odd third taste that I could not identify...and that's the taste I didn't care for.<br /><br />That being said, with alcohol mixed in, I am certain this would probably suffice nicely, especially AFTER the first drink goes down!  ;-)<br /><br />All in all...I wouldn't buy this product again, and I almost didn't want to finish the first pitcher I made (gave the rest away).

I disagree with those that say it is flimsy.  It seems sturdy to me.  In terms of quality, it seems fine.  But in terms of growing sprouts from small seeds, there are 2 main problems, it seems:<br /><br />(1) It has pin-size holes for drainage, and small seeds get stuck in these and grow their roots through them. I am mostly making broccoli sprouts and alfalfa sprouts (small seeds). Probably the Sprout Master would work fine with sunflower seeds, nuts, beans, wheat, or other seeds that are at least as large as a mung bean. What happens with the small seeds, such as the broccoli sprouts, is that they grow their roots through the holes, and their roots make a thick mat underneath. So then it is very hard to remove the entire sprout. The roots break off, so then we have only the tops of the sprouts. I'm able to scrape the roots off of the backside and put them in the salads too, but it's just not as nice as the whole sprout unbroken. I don't have this problem with my other sprouting system, the Tompson & Morgan Seed Sprouter - Two-tiered (also available at Amazon). It works so much better because it has slots instead of pinholes.<br /><br />The broccoli sprouts don't make a mat of roots underneath the tray with the Tompson and Morgan Sprouter. They just make sprouts like you would see in the grocery store. I've also noticed that my sprouts grow much faster in the Tompson and Morgan Sprouter. I've done many comparisons, and it always is like this. I am not sure why. So, all things said, I wish that I hadn't bought the Sprout Master Triple Sprouter. I would have bought several more Tompson and Morgan Sprouters instead. They look very attractive and are a lot easier for me to deal with than the Sprout Master. I'm sure the Sprout Master is great for people that are using the larger seeds. Maybe I will start doing some larger seeds/nuts/beans too, but my main interest is with broccoli sprouts, alfalfa sprouts, radishes sprouts, etc., all of which have tiny seeds.<br /><br />(2) Clean-up:  The other thing about the Sprout Master, as others have noted, is that it's a bit difficult to clean small seeds out of the holes. You have to use the tip of a paperclip to poke stuff out sometimes.<br /><br />Once again the Tompson & Morgan is so much easier -- with their slots instead of pin-size holes, the seeds and other stuff fall right out during a quick wash and rinse. No paperclips and poking needed!<br /><br />And the Tompson & Morgan has gone through my dishwasher many times without harm. Sprout Master says don't put theirs in dishwasher, so I have not.<br /><br />***By the way, if anyone has some ideas for how I can make the Sprout Master work better with my little seeds, I would love to read your comments. Thanks! ***"

Dense material like canned goods should be surrounded with packing peanuts in order to arrive undamaged.  Needless to say, I will not order canned goods again through Amazon.<br /><br />This is not the end of the story.  Amazon's standard policy on damaged food is 10%, or 20% maximum discount.  In this case, 58.3% of the food  arrived damaged--and no way was I going to pay for what I won't use.  After 1/2 hour on the phone, the customer service manager granted me an ""exception"" and allowed a refund of 58.3% of my purchase price.  But I should not have had to waste so much of my time insisting on it.<br /><br />That said, Harmony Farms dog food itself is a great product.  The reason I'm willing to pay almost $2 per can is that it's made in the USA (no danger of melamine, etc.).  So there you have it.

Since I'm not an everyday soda drinker, I'm not particularly concerned when I do drink one that it's low in calories, ""diet,"" or anything else--it's just gotta satisfy my very occasional desire for a soda.

I do like it, but the flavor is less reminiscent of actual blackberries and more reminiscent of that generic blackberry flavor that comes in soda and other products.  I actually like the very small (8.4 oz) cans a lot, since it doesn't take much for me to get a soda fix, and I probably don't need twice as much refined sugar that comes in a larger can.

Too bad it doesn't agree with me.,"I ordered the 3-pound bag of Nutiva 50% Protein Hemp Powder at the beginning of July.  I wanted to replace whey protein with hemp protein to cut down on processed foods for bodybuilding.  The quality of the product was superb and fresh.  Taste-wise, it isn't the best tasting powder in the world, but that can easily be fixed by mixing it with almond milk.<br /><br />After drinking my first shake I noticed a lot of gas and bloating -- which is odd given that this product is supposed to have less bloat than whey.  I figured my body was simply adjusting to the extra fiber and kept taking it for the next month.<br /><br />For the second-third weeks, my body was able to tolerate this stuff relatively well.  However, when I reached the 6-7th week, I started getting severe bloating and stomach pains to the point of vomiting.  In addition, I got a slight headache, slight chills and muscle twitching in my ears.  Given this product's reputation, I didn't want to attribute my problems with this product.  I went to the doctor and he gave me a trial of a proton pump inhibitor.  I suspected my GI problems were due to the pre-workout supplement I was taking.  The proton pump inhibitor should allow my digestive system to heal.<br /><br />To rule this product out, I quit taking the hemp and pre-workout supplement for a few days and simply ate more regular food.  I felt better by the weekend.  After those few days, I tried whey protein.  No bloating.  That night, I tried another hemp shake (with almond milk).  One hour after drinking the shake, I got the severe bloating and pain again.. just as bad as before.  I also got the slight headache, chills and ear muscle twitching.  It definitely isn't the almond milk, as I drink almond milk all the time for breakfast.  It also isn't the fiber, as I eat salads full of broccoli all the time.<br /><br />It appears I have an allergic reaction to hemp protein powder.  That is a shame, given all the health benefits of hemp.<br /><br />For now, I will have to stick to whey."

I only fill the glass a little over half way full with water and mix in the half packet of coffee. Then, I pour in my milk, almost to the top of the glass, and add 2 HEAPING spoon fulls of condensed sweetened milk that I keep in a container in the fridge where it'll last for a long time. That stuff is a bit sticky, (as is anything wonderfully sweet) so stir stir stir! With a few ice cubes thrown in to keep it cold, it's perfection! No need to add any more sugar since I cut the coffee down and add sweetened condensed milk, either. The only complaint I have is what everyone else has noticed as well, that there is a slightly bitter coffee taste."

I picked this up because my wife loves trying new hair products, and I always try them with here.  I didn't know anything about this other than the name ""Ultra Shea Intense Scalp Nourishing Balm"" which sounded pretty simple and universal.  Like everyone, when I got it I wasted time scouring the package for directions (Surprise! There are none!) and then just gave it a shot.<br /><br />After reading several of the reviews here, it looks like this is a race-specific product, of which the packaging gives no clue.  Maybe there are some secret code words I am missing, but I have ""natural hair"" as in the hair on my head is natural.<br /><br />We have two kinds of ""natural hair"" in my household, and this didn't work for either of them.  My wife (Asian; long hair) gave up after one try and said it was way to greasy.  Me (White guy; short hair) was a little more persistent.  I tried it on dry hair and wet hair and moist hair, but to no avail.  It works pretty good as a hair gel, and is powerful enough to stick my hair straight up. I could have used it during my punk rock days to stand up my Mohawk, but then there is the overpowering scent to go with it. I don't think it will replace my standard hair gel anytime soon.<br /><br />It seems like this is more of a marketing fail than a product fail. It has a pretty specific market and use, and is not as general as the name and packaging would lead you to believe."

I started out on the ""Java"" flavor to have a coffee replacement. The thing is, when we are replacing something we can be dissappointed if the new item isn't exactly like like the original. And that's the problemn. There isn't anything that is going to be exactly like coffee except coffee. So between the similar to coffee tasting Java teeccino and changing my frame of mind about no longer trying to make coffee without coffee, I had very good success. Let the new beverage be what it is. In this case Teeccino. So as far as Teeccino goes, I find it delicious. The Java does taste more like coffee than the others. However the vanilla and the mocha both are wonderful tasting. If you get into the Maya blends, they taste a lot like coffee too, but I felt sleepy drinking them. Could have been the Tryptophan or just a sleepy couple of days in my life, haha. At either rate, Teeccino has been a godsend for me. I love them and appreciate having a hot beverage (that isn't tea) that is good for me. Just a reminder, if you are going into this trying to make coffee then buy the Java, and try to remember that it isn't coffee. Otherwise enjoy a good healthy beverage. To me they really do have a wonderful flavor. Remember, the only place you will find coffee is in coffee. Which by the way, I don't even like coffee anymore. I was a coffee junky, from the moment I woke until bed. Meaning there was a cup of coffee on my bedside table. So for me to enjoy another product more than coffee and to not even care to have coffee, is a big deal. Enjoy."

Taken at the dose on the label, I did feel more relaxed and less stressed.  Once it got in my system, it was almost like taking a sleeping pill, as I would get very sleepy within an hour or so of taking it.  The problem for me was that it seemed to build up within my system.  And the relaxed mellow state I started in soon became the fatigued energy-less state.  At first, I didn't realize that it was caused by this product.  But when I stopped taking it, the extreme fatigue did stop.  I'm giving this product five stars, because it works REALLY well.

It tastes just fine. I think that the judgment of taste differs according to whether one is coming to this from cow's milk or from another soy product. I've been drinking soy, and more recently almond milk (unsweetened) for many years. Also, some complained that this is lumpy. There is totally no lumpiness using plain water and shaking (I used a shaker). I thought I was going to need a blender. In addition, this beverage will be a wonderful solution to having a milk drink while traveling. The nutrients are nearly the same as lowfat milk except for far less protein. I did not check for the vitamin D.<br /><br />On the less positive side if you are counting weightwatcher points, this beverage is 2 points; whereas my regular pre-mixed beverage is 1 point. The sugar content is high 5g; (although to my taste it is not overly sweet as some have complained). This beverage seems to have a very slight aftertaste.<br /><br />In summary, I am very pleased with the overall product; especially the cost savings, and the portability. The only reason I won't be using it daily is due to the sugar content.<br /><br />Updated opinion: I have to agree now that this beverage is too sweet, and the aftertaste is bothersome.

It made bad beef palatable.  Sadly, Mom bought half a steer once or twice a year and over-cooked it all.  Seems a well intended but misinformed home economics teacher scared her into cooking everything well beyond well.  Subsequent to that I discovered good beef and that it was silly and unnecessary to to use any kind of a sauce on a lovingly prepared steak.  Sadly life is not one long serving of a grilled medium rare porterhouse with a side of fresh horseradish. You may have your own take on this but you get it.  There are so-so burgers, average steaks at average steak houses and cheap cuts of beef purchased for big BBQ's.  That's where Ring of fire Original Steak Sauce comes in.  I smuggle this stuff into Outback when my family insists on eating there.  It's makes a burger barbeque something special.  Slathered on smoked tri-tip it's the shchizznit.<br /><br />It is only with this sauce that I can eat a burger from a fast food restaurant.  In fact, I marvel at how the #7 Angus Swiss Mushroom Burger at McDonalds tastes better than average with this steak sauce slathered all over it.  Hold the mayo and add extra mushrooms (yes, they will do that for you).  There is subtle and real chemistry at play here.  Mushrooms make beef more savory and juicy.  The heat and complex spices of Ring of Fire Steak Sauce are the salvation of this bland industrial item.  It's good on every burger but especially good when mushrooms are involved.  I'm not sure why.  In fact, I use it on Portobellos I grill and it's enough to make me think I could be a vegan for a day.<br /><br />So here's the bottom-line: this is the best steak sauce ever made.  I've had fancy, gourmet small batch sauce, sauce homemade by grilling gods and just about every other commercial steak sauce in the western world (my sauce spicy sauce collection approaches 100 bottles) and this stuff simply rules.  There's still a place for A1 in my world.  Sometimes you need a sauce with papaya. Sometimes you need something infused with chipotle.  Other times you need something fancy with you've got a special cheese or some other mystery ingredient with your beef.  But this is my go to Steak Sauce and I only wish they sold it in quart sizes.<br /><br />The folks at Ring of Fire also have the best habanero hot sauce ([...] in the entire world so it's no surprise they'd figure out steak sauce so well.  I haven't researched this but everything they sell has some crazy flavors that work and work well.  Hats off to them."

Just a tip: do not assume that you are saving money by buying the big bags of it. Yes, the quantity is larger and there is less packaging, which would make you think that you are saving money, but do the math: they way they are currently priced on Amazon, it is cheaper to buy the 6-pack of smaller boxes than it is to buy the 6-pack of larger bags--yes, I mean price per ounce, not total price.

Due to the increasing demand for olive oil, the trend has been to reduce production costs by moving toward more automation and concentration of production in ever larger installations. These modem factories extract more oil more cheaply, but their processing methods substantially reduce the nutritional quality of the oil.<br /><br />To reduce costs, olives are machine harvested along with leaves and twigs. Olives that have dropped on the ground, which can be said to contain bad oil, are often mixed with the good ones. They are shipped in all kinds of containers, many of which are poorly ventilated, and heaped in large piles where the olives are stored for too long and often become moldy. The oil is then extracted in a continuous centrifuge where hot water is used to help separate out the oil.<br /><br />Antioxidant polyphenols are soluble in water and are washed away in this process, thereby lowering the shelf life and the nutritional quality of the oil. Italy alone produces 800,000 cubic meters of waste water per year from this process. Because substantial amounts of antioxidants are washed away, factory produced olive oils have a short shelf life of only months, whereas real olive oil lasts for two to three years.<br /><br />Most people think that by purchasing ""extra virgin"" olive oil they are getting a high quality oil.  Unfortunately, in most cases, this is not true. It's more complex than that. A label reading extra virgin is no guarantee of quality. For one thing, nowhere does it say that extra virgin olive oil has to be made 100% from olives.<br /><br />Lower quality oils can be refined to bring the acidity down so they can be labeled as extra virgin. But now the oil has been refined, and that's not what you want. That's why being labeled extra virgin is no guarantee of getting high quality oil, which has not been processed in ways that reduce its nutritional value. To complicate matters even more, the term ""extra virgin"" has no official meaning in the United States. The U.S. is not a member of the International Olive Oil Council. So, olive oil sold here can be labeled extra virgin without meeting the accepted international standards.<br /><br />Another reason why you can't trust extra virgin olive oil is exemplified by a problem that manifested last year, and may turn out to be the biggest food fraud of the 20th Century. Despite the fact that details of this scandal have been published in Merum, a Swiss-German magazine, and in Italian journals such as Agra Trade, and the newspaper Gazzetta del Mezzogiorno, this information has been successfully suppressed and is known to only a handful. Investigators are gathering evidence indicating that the biggest olive oil brands in Italy have for years been systematically diluting their extra virgin olive oil with cheap, highly-refined hazelnut oil imported from Turkey. International arrest warrants have been issued and so far documents indicate that at least ten thousand tons of hazelnut oil are involved. As much as 20% hazelnut oil can be added to olive oil and still be undetectable to the consumer. In fact olive oil labeled ""Italian"" often comes from Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco, Spain, and Greece. Considering what has happened in Europe, where there are strict regulations, imagine what can happen in California where there are no regulations. Apparently, more oil is ""produced"" in California than there are olives available. The truth is, most of the extra virgin olive oil on the market does not supply all the nutritional value and health giving properties that we have a right to expect from olive oil.<br /><br />The bottom line is that modem, factory-produced olive oil has been stripped of its health enhancing nutrients, and the task of selecting a high quality oil has been made very difficult.<br /><br />Bariani olive oil is produced by the Bariani family on a small farm in the central valley of California. Their olives are grown without pesticides.  They are hand picked from the trees, carefully washed and dried, and milled with a stone wheel within 48 hours of harvesting. It is pressed in a hydraulic press, collected in stainless steel vats, decanted, and bottled.  This first cold pressed oil is the real stuff and retains all the natural flavor and goodness."

But there are a few things you need to be aware of: there'll be a really fishy smell when you open the bag - don't know why, since the noodles are made from a plant - but rinsing under water will make most of that smell go away. And you do need to make sure they're really dried off before using, in order to not add more liquid to whatever you're mixing them with and also so they will absorb more of a sauce you might be putting on them. The manufacturer suggests putting the rinsed and drained noodles in a hot pan and ""sauteing"" for about a minute (took me longer) until they make a squeaky sort of sound to really remove all the excess moisture.<br /><br />I first tried these noodles with spaghetti sauce - absorbed and held the sauce very well and really they were pretty close to pasta. But, a little part of me detected that fishy smell - faint, yes, but it was still there. A tiny bit unpleasant, since that's not a smell I want with a dish that doesn't have fish in it! Maybe boiling them for a minute before using like the manufacturer suggests in certain recipes, but not all, found on their site, may help. Or maybe rinsing under running water for a longer period of time is the answer.<br /><br />The only other thing I found is that the 7oz. bag really isn't quite enough for a meal portion for me - maybe 1-1/2 bags will do. I'm not an over-eater but I think I'd be more satisfied, especially if using these in place of a main course pasta dish, to use more than one bag per serving.<br /><br />But I like them, am learning to figure out how to best cook with them and will be ordering more.

We keep a small bag in the car for travel to reinforce when our puppy doesn't bark at people walking by, one by the door to reinforce when she goes to the bathroom outside, and a bunch of treats in a treat bag for travel.<br /><br />The one downside to these is that because they're not as stinky, it can be harder to use them to get your dog's attention if he or she is distracted, like at the dog park or if you have a bunch of visitors.  Our trick to get around this is that we put some stinky treats in the treat bag with these, and they'll take on some of the scent (We use <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002DGRSY"">Pro-Treat Beef Liver, Freeze Dried Dog Treats, 21 Ounce</a>).<br /><br />Our dog loves all flavors."

I have always loved the Natural, micro brew, old fashioned root beers.  But for some reason the root beer I liked the best was Boylan's Root beer which ironically is an artificial root beer.  Then one day I was strolling throught the soda section of my local health food store looing for some natural root beers when I stumbled upon Boylan's ""The Natural Kind"" Root Beer.  I almost fainted right there in the aisle!  It was my favorite root beer only better! it was made micro-brew style with REAL ingredients.  Then for about 2 months I was constantly in and out of the store getting that root beer.  I was just like the Boylan's root beer that I had come to love only it was, as I said above, better!  First of all, the second you taste the root beer you can tell the quality of craftsman-ship that went into making the root beer.  The root beer is creamy and velvetly smoothe.  It just slides down your throat.  The amazing thing is that you then notice that it is definitley the signature Boylan's cane sugar root beer flavor.  The flavor is deep and complex but mild.  I know this sounds contradictory but you'll understand when you taste it for yourself.  Then something terrible happened.  I was going into the store to get my weekly bottle only to find that the store had discontinued the root beer.  I was so upset I seriously almost cried.

ICV D-47 strain was selected from 450 isolates collected between 1986 and 1990.<br /><br />Oenological properties and applications<br />The ICV D-47 is a low-foaming quick fermenter that settles well, forming a compact lees at the end of fermentation. This strain tolerates fermentation temperatures ranging from 15° to 20°C (59° to 68°F) and enhances mouthfeel due to complex carbohydrates. Malolactic fermentation proceeds well in wine made with ICV D-47.<br /><br />Recommended for making wines from white varieties such as Chardonnay and ros&eacute; wines.

The reason is that wheat gluten is about the #1 cause of allergies in dogs.  When wheat gluten is broken down it gets very sticky, so it coats the cilia of the digestive tract.  This can cause irritation, and cause the immune system to actually destroy the lining of the intestines.  This means that your pup might not be able to absorb all the nutrients he is eating.<br /><br />Often allergies show up as 'hot spots' where the dog gets itchy and possibly scratches fur off.  The problem with food allergies is it's possible that they won't be obvious because all the damage will be internal.<br /><br />So, I have not seen a problem with this product, but I have known dogs who have had terrible reactions to wheat.  It's the same things as ""gluten intolerance""in humans, but it's much more common in dogs who are not quite as good at digesting grains.  Wheat flour can be bad enough, but including concentrated wheat protein is much worse - because that is what causes the allergies."

I wanted to try it for three reasons: 1)Honestly, a trusted friend suggested it, 2)I'm always looking for healthy snacks to fill my day (I'm on the go constantly), 3)Cacao's ""supposed"" health benefits (I'm not saying it does or does not have them...just alluding to the fact that I'm no health/nutritional expert). So, here's what I think. These are going to be an acquired taste (like beer). Actually, they very much remind me of a red wine (a burgundy, maybe)...the bag even smells like wine when you open it up. They are very tiny pieces. They are very crunchy (if you have teeth that are very sensitive I'd think twice about getting these). Upon tasting them: on the front of the palate it tasted very much like a red wine, then slightly bitter, and moving to the back of the palate it tasted very earthy and you got the flavor of cocoa powder...then swallow (you are going to want something to rinse it down...it's a little grainy at that point). I like the texture and I like the taste (but then again, I like wine). I have mixed it into yogurt and I find it rather good...you get less of the wine/bitter flavors and more of the earthy and traditional cocoa powder flavors. I use honey flavored Greek yogurt. I also eat them plain as little nibbles...they don't bother me that way either (a little ""wake-me-up""). If the flavor really offends you, but you want the health benefits, you can order Organic Sugar Cacao Nibs (do an internet search), they are tossed with organic cane syrup (I will try those for a treat soon). That's all I got! Cheers."

(they do sell greens+ powder)<br /><br />Same on all other flavors, yogurt more sour and berry burn, chia a little crunchier, chocolate chia and plain green slightly more powdery and sour flavor.<br /><br />Comparisons: W/ Odwalla similar, but odwalla more chewiness, texture, more powdery taste, lighter sweetness. Both kind of taste dead<br />Lara bars: much more sour (a little aggravating) and smooth (some with whole nuts or dried berry chunks), sweetness more pure, also lacks liveliness food should have.<br />gnu bar: similar fiber taste as greens- less chunkiness than odwalla bar, better flavor (less powdery taste) - not craved for nutritional kick.<br />greens bar are densest.<br /><br />Ordered on amazon 10/19 recieved 10/26 from NY-CA.

182508,182509,B008RWUKXK,A3ANETCTMAN1NP,JJ,0,0,3,1319500800,Review for both Cinnamon and Vanilla Blueberry flavors,"NOTE: Because Amazon has all of the ""Kind Healthy Grains Clusters"" reviews linked together, it is necessary for me to say that this review is for only the cinnamon and vanilla blueberry flavors.<br /><br />After trying Kind's cinnamon clusters and loving them, I was really excited about trying all of the Kind Clusters!  Unfortunately, I didn't like the vanilla blueberry at all and found that they actually turned me off about wanting any more Kind Clusters.<br /><br />While the cinnamon taste popped out as soon as the cluster hits my tongue, the vanilla blueberry didn't even taste like it was supposed to!  It tasted more like sour apple juice and less like any form of blueberry!  Plus, I didn't detect any vanilla flavor at all.  I really enjoyed munching on the cinnamon clusters by themselves as a light snack whenever I felt like nibbling.  However, I needed something to drown out the vanilla blueberry clusters' nasty flavor and wouldn't eat them without milk or yogurt.  I'm sure that the cinnamon clusters would have been just as delicious with those two additions, as well.<br /><br />Both of these flavored clusters only have molasses and evaporated cane juice as sweeteners; therefore, they won't be as sugary as some people like their snacks; however, this lack of refined sugar makes the clusters healthier than most foods on the market.  Besides the already-mentioned molasses and cane juice, other ingredients include the following: whole grains (gluten free oats, brown rice, buckwheat, amaranth, millet, quinoa), flax seeds, chicory root fiber, canola oil, cinnamon, sea salt, and Vitamin E.  The vanilla blueberry ingredients are different in that there is no cinnamon but there is vanilla extract, blueberry puree, apple puree, plum puree, apple juice, glycerine, citrus fiber, and citrus pectin.  I'm baffled as to why plum and apple products are added to a supposedly vanilla blueberry food.  All the ingredients are without a doubt extremely healthy.<br /><br />A serving size is about 1/3 cup which has 120-130 calories, 3-3.5 grams of fat, and 5-6 grams of sugar.  Other nice things to note are the calcium, protein, and iron that are present.<br /><br />I love the cinnamon flavor and highly recommend it, giving it a rating of 4/5.  The vanilla blueberry flavor was repulsive to me, though, and I would only give it a score of 2/5.  Overall, Kind Clusters are a highly healthy snack that's easy to grab a handful of.  I recommend trying the cinnamon, although I warn against getting the vanilla blueberry.  As for whether or not to try other flavors, that's completely up to you.  I will probably not be doing so in the near future."

One is about 8 years old, grey shorthair domestic, and very calm by nature.  The other is about 4 years old, abyssinian, and a loud pain in the butt by nature.<br /><br />I've been feeding them the Nutro for fat cats, and they eat it up, but never all at once.  I decided against IAMS a long time ago because of their issues with animal cruelty while doing their nutrition/diet tests on animals.<br /><br />Today I decided to buy them Newman's Own Adult Cat.  I didn't give them too much since it's not a weight control formula (which, frankly, both my cats need).  They both practically inhaled this stuff.  Later on the abyssinian even went back to lick the dish some more.<br /><br />After they ate it they both instantly became very calm and went to sleep.<br /><br />I'll keep an eye on how much they keep on liking this food.  If all goes well, I'll keep buying it despite the slightly higher price.  (The price at Whole Foods was similar to the price here on Amazon... where can I get this for the other price people have seen?  That's like half the price... are you guys sure you're getting the same size bags?)  But it's Newman's Own and they give money to animal charities, so that takes some edge off the price.<br /><br />My only wish is they also made a weight control cat food as well."

I tasted them and they really aren't that nice.  She also started  get diaper rash for the first time ever, every time I fed her these, and it cleared up every time I stopped.<br /><br />Basically they are good if you have no alternative, but nothing beats homemade.

Plus a lot of the nutrients will have been processed out if them in the canning process,  so not the best thing to feed your child long term generally.

I compared it to Blue Buffalo, which is great but still a little pricey, the labels were almost identical. What a God send! Unfortunately, neither one of my girls liked the food. They disliked it so much so they did not eat for 3 days. I added a little water to release the aroma, I soaked it in chiken broth, they just didnt want it. Maybe my girls are spoiled.

Do I like it? Not really. Maybe its with age or refined taste or my lack of interest in snacks and sweet foods in my older years, but I found this cookie very sweet. Not just in the chocolate chips, but the cookie itself seemed very sugary. Also, in addition to the many chocolate chips, it looks like they baked one giant chip smack in the middle to ensure every bite gets a chocolaty taste. So it seems overkill on the sweetness factor. And because this is a cookie that is manufactured by food scientists to ensure sameness in every cookie, it ended up tasting on the artifical side. Perhaps these would taste better fresh out of an oven and have a warm taste, but that is a preference for the individul to determine. But they are not sold that way, so I am taking it as it is given.

Since I could not envision 3 bones having a retail value was $57.60; so I ordered, the ""bones"" with the hope that there were more. I assumed that this must be a closeout, and I thought I was going to get a good deal.  WHAT I GOT was 1 femur bone, if I had known it was ONE bone, I would NOT have ordered. ONE bone with a retail value of $57.60?????<br /><br />To the company's credit, they did refund me when I complained about being misled by the information in the ad. I have not seen the correction on my billing yet, but I would assume that since they told me it was being issued, that it will be on my next statement.<br /><br />Please note: You are NOT getting a good buy, or what you think you will get when ordering this product.  Since you get ONE bone; I believe that this one 6 oz bone at $1.72, plus $5.49 shipping is too expensive.  You are paying($7.21) for one bone that would cost $2.00 or less at a pet store."

So, I bought a pack of 6.3 ounces and it contained six tortas. Well, they're like a five-inch diameter thin crispy pastry disk that is somewhat like a pie crust. It's fragile and quite easily broken. The flavor is light and slightly sweet. The instructions suggest to serve them with cheese, perhaps also with coffee or tea. I had one with my evening salad meal. One of the tortas is listed as 14o calories and half of that is fat, presmably olive oil. So, now I know what tortas are.

For a great, easy meal on an evening when you are too tired to make a curry from scratch, saute some onions, throw in a can of tomatoes, some water, and a few tablespoons of Patek's Mild Curry Paste, and then you can take it wherever you like it--meat, tofu, veggies--as your fancy strikes you.<br /><br />Now this paste may say ""mild,"" but there is still enough spice to make your mouth tingle pleasantly--just enough. When I serve Patek's mild, I take out some chicken or whatever before serving to my four-year-old--I don't think she could handle the ""mild"" spice level. Mom and Dad love it, though.<br /><br />The downside is that one little jar does not go a long way. If you use the paste in the concentration that it calls for (and I recommend doing so, for an authentic Indian taste), you will get two or three dinners out of it. But for flavor and ease of use and sheer delight, you cannot beat Patek's. The guests you serve it to will be amazed--and you can hide your little jar in the refrig and bask in all that glory.<br /><br />Amazon's cost is high for this item, at $5, but if convenience is important to you, then that's a consideration--having a powerful culinary secret delivered to your door might make the extra buck or two worth it. If you have time and are near an Asian/Indian foods store, then expect to pay $3 if you are lucky, or around $4 in most places. Stock up, because unopened, these last forever."

I was very surprised to learn how this oil had been the primary source of oil in the United States until there was a propagandist pitch against buying this oil due to conflicts of the world war at the time, as well as the increased interest in corn oil manufacturing in the U.S. Coconut oil became a target of U.S. corn and vegetable oil manufacturers. Today, it's nearly been forgotten or written off because of it's high saturated fat content.  Interesting to note that this oil's properties do not act like other saturated fats because it is a medium-chain triglyceride, which breaks down differently in the liver. After reading the information I gave it a go and I love it.  It is great for all sorts of cooking. It even blends well into a protein shake. It smells wonderful and works as a great skin conditioner and massage oil.  I would highly recommend coconut oil to everyone.

I am asking Amazon for a refund - otherwise, they are going in the trash unused.<br /><br />Copied from FDA web site.<br /><br />FDA Continues to Caution Dog Owners About Chicken Jerky Products<br />November 18, 2011<br /><br />The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is again cautioning consumers that chicken jerky products for dogs (also sold as chicken tenders, strips or treats) may be associated with illness in dogs. In the last 12 months, FDA has seen an increase in the number of complaints it received of dog illnesses associated with consumption of chicken jerky products imported from China. These complaints have been reported to FDA by dog owners and veterinarians.<br /><br />FDA issued a cautionary warning regarding chicken jerky products to consumers in September 2007 and a Preliminary Animal Health Notification in December of 2008. After seeing the number of complaints received drop off during the latter part of 2009 and most of 2010, the FDA is once again seeing the number of complaints rise to the levels of concern that prompted release of our earlier warnings.<br /><br />Chicken jerky products should not be substituted for a balanced diet and are intended to be fed occasionally in small quantities.<br /><br />FDA is advising consumers who choose to feed their dogs chicken jerky products to watch their dogs closely for any or all of the following signs that may occur within hours to days of feeding the products: decreased appetite; decreased activity; vomiting; diarrhea, sometimes with blood; increased water consumption and/or increased urination. If the dog shows any of these signs, stop feeding the chicken jerky product. Owners should consult their veterinarian if signs are severe or persist for more than 24 hours.

Also, some vitamins and minerals are added.<br /><br />Sour Apple ingredients are exactly the same, except there is no coloring added.<br /><br />The ""organic flavor"" ingredients are not specified, nor are the fruit and vegetable juices used for color.  We can assume that these ingredients do vary among the different flavored fruit ropes, but we don't know what they are.<br /><br />These fruit ropes do not have the fruit taste we thought they should.  Our family didn't like them very much.  They aren't terrible -- we just don't think they're good enough to purchase again; but maybe that's just because we're accustomed to natural foods.<br /><br />The ingredients aren't bad either, but they're nothing exciting -- as far as we can tell, they're just apple (pectin comes from apples) with anonymous color and flavor enhancers (and the supplemental vitamins and minerals).<br /><br />Additionally, among the Tropical Twist flavored fruit ropes were several that had not been packaged properly.  The ropes were sticking out the bottoms of the wrappers, having been squished along with the wrapper when the machinery pressure/heat sealed them.<br /><br />The reviewers who thought these were very chewy must have gotten stale ones.  The fresh ones are on the softer side, but still sticky.  (Braces wearers, beware.)<br /><br />For small, individually-wrapped dried fruit treats, I would recommend Stretch Island fruit leather instead.  These contain the fruits named in their flavors (e.g. the ingredients in Stretch Island's ""orchard cherry"" fruit leather are: apple puree concentrate, cherry puree concentrate, orange puree concentrate, natural black cherry flavor) and they taste like those fruits, too, without being too sweet or tart or sticky."

That's how much.  This is the church's morning tea supply for the next few months.<br /><br />The pyramid teabag is very nice.  The bag material appears to be a standard tea bag like the kind used by Celestial Seasonings, but the four corners of the bag were formed into a pyramid instead of a square.  A tea bag, of course, will retain some air as it is steeped.  A square tea bag will float flat on the surface of the water.  A pyramid, on the other hand, floats as an upside down pyramid.  I don't know why the air doesn't collect in one of the corners, but it doesn't.  Bottom line: the rest of the bag, and thus the tea, is submerged, which makes for a (in my opinion) much better steep than a square bag.<br /><br />The tea itself is quite enjoyable, although I am not a connoisseur by any means.  I use one bag in the morning to make about a liter of tea, then down it with a big breakfast.  This tea is not as in-your-face earthy as the last black tea I tried (a Yorkshire blend), and I like it better.  It still has that earth and slightly bitter flavor, but it is a little sweeter than the Yorkshire blend I tried, probably because it is made from the tips of the plant, as the product name states, or perhaps it came from a different and better crop, or some other reason that I do not know.

I noticed that many of my favorite food items which I have ordered from Amazon and that are included in their Subscribe and Save program are unavailable with a comment stating we do not know if these will be available again. This is especially annoying to someone like me who has to watch my caloric intake.

However, you can't beat the price. In our local supermarket, it is far cheaper than other GF products, and only a tad bit more than non-GF cake mix. Amazon's subscription-price isn't much lower than our supermarket, so I'll still buy it there.

I apply the treatment directly to my scalp using a hair dye application bottle (with a small pointed tip), and then wrap my hair up in a towel for about an hour.  I then wash it out and style normally. I am not sure how it works, but I am now losing about 1/4 of the hair that I used to during my daily washing/styling routine.  I also noticed that my scalp doesn't itch anymore.  It was never a big problem in the past, but it is something that I have noticed :)<br /><br />I also started having acne a few months ago, and I went to my doctor, and he prescribed an antibiotic cream, because he thought it was an allergic reaction to something.  The antibiotic cream didn't clear up the acne.  On a whim (again), I applied a 50/50 ratio of Bragg's vinegar to my face at night on a cotton ball (I take off my makeup with this mixture instead of washing my face; I hate washing my face at night for some reason), and within a week, my acne completely cleared up.  Again, I don't have any idea how this works, but it has worked wonderfully for me.<br /><br />My skin loves this stuff, and I am so happy that I found it.

I spend copious amounts of time and money on a variety of flours. When I found this mix, it was like a gift from God. I've since tried several other mixes, but none turned out as consistent a product as this mix. I do make some tweaks, however. I add a packet of unflavored gelatin (increases the protein content and helps with texture) and a teaspoon of xanthan gum. Often I will use my own yeast, just to make sure it's fresh. With these tweaks, I can easily make very good bread--without a bread maker (I have one, but I get much better results without it). I do find that I have to double the cooking time, but that could be from our area's temp and humidity and our oven.<br /><br />I've occasionally tried some variations, such as raisin and cinnamon, poppyseed, etc., with varying results. Overall, however, this is so much better than the awful pre-made, mass-produced shelf-stable breads, better than other mixes, and as good as many of the local freshly-baked GF breads that sell for eight dollars a loaf in our area. My son still likes his frozen bread for some sandwiches, but otherwise we often make this.<br /><br />Amazon's subscription-price is competitive, so we'll move to that!<br /><br />Updated to add that I no longer add xanthan gum to the mix, and the results are just as good.  With better proofing, my cooking time is only a little longer than what is listed on the box. Try cooling the loaf in the oven, with the temp turned off and the door opened a little bit."

The conditioner allows me to much more easily run a brush through my hair. Without flattening my hair it reduces the dryness that flat ironing can do and reduces breakage.  It really does lock in moisture and provide long lasting nourishment.  The Therapy works best on wet hair, it gives deep, non-greasy nourishment to my hair and lends a healthy looking shine.  I can wash, condition and therapy my hair Monday. Tuesday I can wet my hair put the therapy in and it looks brand new.<br /><br />The real test was going to my salon and my stylist of 8 years noticed the difference in softness.

When the ketchup arrived, however, I was disappointed to taste - and find that this was, IMHO, just as sweet as any other ketchup on the market.  The key is that, NO, there is no added sugar, no corn syrup - but the product uses agave as a natural sweetener.

When I was offered an opportunity to review this similar product, I was skeptical that anything could top my favorite granola.  Instead, I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the Kind Cinnamon Oat Clusters granola.  It actually tasted fresher than Bear Naked and I can eat 1/3 of a cup for roughly the same calories as 1/4 cup of Bear Naked.  (The rest of the nutritional info is roughly the same between the two brands.)  The Kind granola has a nice crunch and didn't get soggy when mixed with yogurt.  The cinnamon flavor is subtle and not overpowering.  It's packed with whole grains, Omega 3 and other healthy ingredients.  It would also be good served as a cereal with milk.  It's a bit more expensive than Bear Naked, but if both were on the same shelf, I would definitely reach for the Kind Cinnamon Oat Clusters.  I would also be interested in trying other versions/flavors of this product."

Most teas make me a little nauseous or seem to fire up my heartburn not to mention their wake-up power was in caffeine still.  Doing some research I discovered the healthy aspects of yerba mate and decided to give it a try.  It does help to break through and give me a quick awake that lasts much longer than caffeine without the jitters and heartburn.  I do not think I would go so far as to say it is better than coffee at bringing me out of that groggy feeling - but it is certainly a different, milder and calmer kind of alert.  A cup of this in the morning and occasionally in the afternoon is all I generally need to keep me going and never once has heartburn or nausea set in afterwards.<br /><br />There are many other coffee substitutes out there, some do a fair job of matching coffee flavor, this is not a good choice for coffee flavor but it is the one best for the morning wake up.  Very good product.  Do some research because overuse of yerba mate has been linked with some health concerns but I would not worry with just a cup or two a day."

However, since my family was used to Swanson, we found recipes that we were used to tasted different.  Although my taste buds are not smart enough to know what the difference was, I assume this comes from the combination of ingredients used to make this broth.

In the long run going organic is the best thing for our family and despite tasting different this broth is still delicious.

Those amino-acids contain a large proportion of essential amino-acids, particularly lysine, together with glutamic acid. The Yeast Extracts contain a maximum of 18 % glutamic acid on the basis of the total protein content (total glutamic acid refers to both free glutamic acid and glutamic acid in small peptides). The free glutamic acid content is between 6 % and 13 % of the total protein content. This free glutamic acid, which is a natural component of Yeast Extract, plays a major role in its aromatic power. Glutamic acid, also referred to as monosodium glutamate (MSG) has flavor enhancing capabilities and is associated with Umami, the fifth taste sensation.""<br />-www.yeastextract.info"

As soon as we changed to Dr Harvey's they wolfed down the food and after a couple months the skin irritation problems disappeared.

We are sold on the properties of this food, and have started using it on our latest rescue dog a 1 year old Australian Cattle dog, and she loves it.

These chips don't have any sour to them at all, and taste just like them but a lot less strong aftertaste.  If you want to try out Salt and Vinegar chips I suggest you try these out first.

There are also plant based oils in here, but they come about halfway down the list of ingredients, so I wouldn't call this a ""natural"" product.

For many years, I have bought high-end beans, stored them carefully and ground them right before making a pot of coffee.  My husband and I have a fine dining restaurant, and the coffee we serve there is simply wonderful, because I carefully sourced the coffee we buy to get the best possible flavor.<br /><br />So, when I was given a Keurig as a gift, I was not exactly thrilled.  I am the only coffee drinker in our house, and I thought it would be wonderfully convenient, although I was concerned about the quality of the coffee available for it.  I had no idea it would be as bad as it was.  I know you have to kiss a lot of frogs before you meet a prince, but I sure didn't think I would buy and taste so much pitifully poor coffee in my search for something good.  I tried so many of those environmentally-unfriendly little plastic cups, and even the five-star ones were ... meh.  I even bought several contraptions that let you use your own coffee, but they were more trouble to use than making a whole pot of the stuff, defeating -- for me, at least -- the whole purpose of having a Keurig.  I seriously considered just giving the thing away.<br /><br />Then I saw these lower-priced, more environmentally-friendly pods from San Francisco Bay.  I read the reviews and decided to give it a try.  When my pods arrived, I opened the bag and was greeted by the wonderful aroma of GOOD COFFEE!  My hopes soared.  When I tasted my first cup, I was so happy that I went through my office giving pods to my coffee-loving friends (we use Keurig at my day job).  It's still nowhere near the coffee in our restaurant, but I can at last have GOOD COFFEE at work!  The fact that these are more environmentally friendly and cheaper than the bad K-cups I've bought in the past is just a bonus!<br /><br />I bought several varieties and am happy with all of them, though the Rainforest Blend is my favorite so far, rich but not bitter and with wonderful coffee flavor and aroma.  It's a bit of a pain to keep them in a ziplock bag, but you get used to it, and the coffee is certainly worth it.<br /><br />FWIW, I also tried another environmentally-friendlier pod, Cameron's, and found it not nearly as good as the San Francisco Bay coffee.  I'll stick with SFB from now on, and I'm keeping the Keurig."
73931,73932,B004JRKEH4,AQQFI7YHMRL7S,James Morris,0,0,3,1317859200,No mi quiero Taco Bell,"I enjoy trying new flavors, especially sauces and sandwich dressings.  I once inadvertently discovered that a certain flavor of a certain brand of salad dressing is pure heaven on a roast beef sandwich, and now I won't eat roast beef without it.<br /><br />When I saw that Taco Bell had come out with a new line of sandwich dressings, I figured it couldn't hurt to try.  As an Amazon Vine customer, I was able to get two free bottles, so I chose Taco Bell Bold & Creamy Chipotle sauce and Bold & Creamy Jalape&ntilde;o sauce.  The idea of trying them on a sandwich made my mouth water.<br /><br />I had a guest who wanted to try the Chipotle sauce.  OK by me; I figured I'd keep the Jalape&ntilde;o for myself.  He took one bite, on a ham and cheese sandwich, and pronounced it, ""Flavored mayonnaise"".  I remember thinking it couldn't be that bad, but it didn't bode well that he didn't finish the sandwich.<br /><br />A week or so later, I got some take-out chicken fingers and figured they'd be good to try the sauce with.  Since the Chipotle was already opened, I poured some on a plate used it to dip my chicken fingers in.  I dipped it in.  I tried one, two, three chicken fingers.  My friend was wrong.  It didn't taste like flavored mayonnaise.  It tasted like generic, store brand flavored mayonnaise.  Like real Chipotle, it had a mildly smoky, bacon flavor.  But beyond cheap - it was very, very cheap tasting.<br /><br />This brings us to today.  I had a friend over, and I made some frozen chicken (General Taos's Chicken, if you must know).  As the chicken was frozen and rather bland, I figured it was time to try the Jalape&ntilde;o sauce.  I put some out in a dish and we tried it, dipping our chicken into it.  Yecch!  This time, it tasted like generic, Jalape&ntilde;o flavored store brand flavored mayonnaise.  It wasn't very spicy, as I would expect Jalape&ntilde;o to be.  It also wasn't terribly flavorful and, on the whole, it reminded me of the Chipotle sauce, just a little more spicy and maybe a little more boring and cheap tasting.  I wanted to be as fair as possible, so I gamely continued on for another few pieces.  When I realized it had ruined my dinner and I'd had enough, I'd had enough.<br /><br />Shortly before starting this review, I dumped the two half-empty bottles of sauce into my garbage can.  From now on, when I think of sandwich sauces, well, ""Yo no quiero Taco Bell"".<br /><br />Not recommended."

This coffee is not as strong to me as this company's Fog Chaser brand, and is good-tasting that not only tastes great but has a nice aroma.<br /><br />The pods are a little different than your traditional plastic K-cup portion as, instead of any plastic around the sides or bottom you have basically a mesh coffee filter holding the coffee grounds. This appears to make a more complete brew, and allows more of the flavor to come into the actual coffee. You will see a dirty residue at the bottom of your cup due to this filtration system vs. a ""clean"" look from a normal K-cup pod. This seems to make sense as the normal K-cup pod has all of the brewed coffee escaping through the pinprick hole vs. the full brewing experience of these pods.<br /><br />As the pods are in this filtration medium the coffee is not air-tight sealed after you open the package of pods.

It works wonders to combat laryngitis as well. This tea contains 100% natural orange pekoe and orange pekoe black teas. Moreover, the tea bags contain decaffeinated tea which means you'll never lose a night's sleep to this tea! SMILE<br /><br />Moreover, there are no additives nor are there preservatives. You can use these tea bags a very long time after you bought them in a store or here at Amazon.com online. Amazon states that this tea has antioxidants and in fact it does--but the antioxidants are in the form of flavonoids which are all natural antioxidants. Scientists still need to conduct more research on this topic; but there is growing evidence at the time of this writing that flavonoids reduce the risk for coronary heart disease as well as the risk of gastric, esophageal and skin cancers. Tea flavonoids can also improve your body's immune system.<br /><br />Yes, you can serve this tea iced with lemon; but I normally find it most useful for those nasty winter months when I inevitably catch a miserable cold. I boil water; I add the tea bag and then I let it steep for a few minutes. I add milk and one packet of ""sweet and low"" and it's absolutely delicious!<br /><br />The price is right, too: the cost per tea bag works out to be about 17 cents per tea bag. You can use a tea bag twice if you wish but after two uses the tea bag has probably served its' ""tour of duty.""<br /><br />Overall, this is a fine quality tea that will not over stimulate you with caffeine. It is an aromatic hot beverage for when you have a cold and it also makes a delicious iced tea drink on a baking--hot summer's day.

Gigi spends her time under the bed, Sophie is wherever I am. What Sophie eats is actually still TBD. This is Gigi's review.<br /><br />Both of them have been picky eaters. Gigi went years on starving herself until she couldn't hold out any longer, then deigning to eat the dry food we supply between wet food dinners, even as we tried all kinds of different foods to tempt her. <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012KH02I"">Beneful Dog Food Prepared Meals Beef Stew Dog Food, 10-Ounce Plastic Containers (Pack of 8)</a> used to work now and then, and though it was expensive, we could get 3 servings from it. However, even though it had a lid, it would often grow moldy even before the next meal. So even though she liked it, it was wasted and really too expensive anyway.<br /><br />When Sohpie arrived, we'd been serving <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002CJF62Y"">Mighty Dog Hearty Pulled-Style Chicken Dinner In Gravy, 5.5-Ounce Cans (Pack of 24)</a> with the longest sustained success yet, about a year. Only chicken, mind you, and it had to be the chunky in sauce kind, NOT the pate kind. Well, along came the puppy, and Gigi expressed her distaste by wasting food again.<br /><br />Finally, I've found Cesar. And oddly, now it has to be the pât&eacute; kind, I.e. ""in meaty juices"" NOT the chunky kind! But AT LAST we've found a dog food that The Mrs. will absolutely SNARF ON. She doesn't come up for air when I put any chicken-based ""in meaty juices"" Cesar dinner in front of her, which I cube into bite sizes.<br /><br />The added bonus is that I can hide pills in the cubes. Gigi's been diagnosed with congenital heart failure, and she's on 3 different pills, 3 times a day. Dinner is the easier dose, because I just push the little pills into the soft pât&eacute;, and she's none the wiser because she swallows the cubes almost whole! Sadly, we won't probably have Gigi with us for the fourteen or fifteen years I've been blessed to have spent with my previous dogs. But I'm determined to make sure she's as healthy and happy as possible in the time we have. She may be feisty, prickly, and a loner, but when I *can* catch her, she does love to snuggle with her mama.<br /><br />Cesar ""in nearby juices"" dog food might just give me a few month's more snuggled than we'd otherwise have."

We even got some plain freeze-dried chicken chunks recently and he was excited but not freakout-excited like my other cat gets.<br /><br />But as soon as he got a whiff of this, he went from disinterested in treat time to holy-moly-let-me-climb-your-leg-give-it-to-me-now excited. He ran in circles trying to anticipate where I'd put it down!<br /><br />The pucks are kind of huge for cats - 1.75"" diameter - but they're a soft puck made of freeze-dried powdery foods, so it's easy for them to nibble and fuss with it until it's gone. It takes them about a minute to fully finish their pucks, even with ravenous chomping.<br /><br />It has natural ingredients, but it's not all meat, so there are veggies in there as well. Is that good? I don't know. Most ""primal"" foods do have some vegetation in there as well, so it seems standard for this type of pet food line.<br /><br />The only thing I dislike is that the pucks are powdery enough that they make a crumbly mark where they are set down, so if I treat the cats on my carpet or couch, there's powder left over that they can't get at without licking it up. Other than that, this is a winner. We are rotating between this treat and the freeze-dried chicken breast treat, and one cat prefers these and one cat prefers the other, so overall, I definitely like this product and plan to buy more when my initial package runs out."

I picked up the spoon again and commanded the brown goo to give me more more more. Well, still sparingly, but, nevertheless... more. I used no more than 1/2 teaspoon on my slice of toast. I had a second slice with another almost 1/2 teaspoon. I updated my Facebook status. People replied in curiosity, in fellowship or in disgust. Or all of the above.

The sale price here at Amazon was awesome - less than half the price at my local stores for a whole case.<br /><br />I never have any trouble getting all of the food out of the pouch - it all slides right out. This particular flavor though for whatever reason does have a bit more product in the pouch and to make things easier when opening, I usually just cut the top off (to avoid any messes while tearing open) or, I tear from one side half way and then from the other side the rest of the way and the entire top comes off then. If there are any dribbles then, it is just a tiny bit on the side of the pouch and not on my hands at all and I do not get splattered with it. For some reason, the top usually never tears cleanly the whole way across if you try to tear it from one side only and it can be a little messy if you're in a hurry. It is not like it makes a huge mess though anyway, just a few drips here and there maybe. Cutting the top off instead of tearing it solves that though.<br /><br />The other Whiskas pouches that I like to use are the Choice Cuts varieties. They have nice big chunks in them instead of a bunch of mush or all shreds. My cat likes the chunkier ones better."

I have used bath and body products that are packaged such that it is next to impossible to open the packaging.

I do not have severe dry skin so perhaps this product is meant for people who have more of a problem with dryness. The oiliness is short-term, though, and after skipping a day my skin returns to normal.<br /><br />This is a nice product for men with dry skin. It smells nice and it leave you feeling clean.

The package arrived in two days; excellent!  There were two orders of 3 cans in this box (total of 6 cans), which was correct.<br /><br />However, three cans were in their original packaging: a flimsy but sealed plastic bag with a lot of room inside; the other three were loose and obviously slid around quite a lot.  Why were those three taken out of their bag?  Furthermore, I'm not prone to exaggeration, and take the blunt approach: every single can was horribly dented and scraped up, rendering the product inside untrustworthy (we know it's not entirely safe to eat food from a bashed-up can, right?!).  Why?  There was zero cushioning and a ton of room inside.  It should go without saying that loose metal cans containing food will bang hard into each other in transit, so some padding would be necessary... but it didn't exist here.  This was my first problem with anything ordered via Amazon.com, and thankfully it was handled expeditiously with a replacement order since I cannot return it to show how poor a packaging job was done (""Thank you"" to a rep named Joy; a sweet individual who was more than accomodating when I quietly explained what happened and asked what can be done; kudos and positive feedback was written about her in Amazon's survey after she handled the order replacement and sent a confirmation email).<br /><br />Nonetheless, I will not allow this to tarnish my use of Amazon.com in the future, and will consider it a one-off.  Perhaps I will write an actual review of the product itself once I receive the next batch.<br /><br />Update, 9/11/10: Second (replacement) shipment arrived. Packaging was apparently from a different location and done better: cans were arranged in a more fitting box so there was less ""wiggle room,"" and a plastic cushion bag was laid across them.  Cans were hardly dented.  About the product itself: the 15-oz. weight is INCLUDING the water in which the mussels are packed; otherwise, it's around the 9-oz. the label states.  The mussels are little ones, and already cooked.  They're soft and fairly firm, not very chewy at all, lightly salted, have a light odor (less so once the water is dumped and the mussels washed), good light green color, and taste appropriately.  While I wouldn't eat many of these as an appetizer (which the label suggests), I've already prepared a seafood soup using them and a curried rice dish... both with excellent results.  Because they're already basically prepared, cooking time was nicely reduced.  I highly recommend these as a trustworthy ingredient!<br /><br />Update, 1/29/11: Second order placed for this product under a subscription and using an extra 15% Roland product discount (nice incentive!).  Same issue as the first.  Can't fault the product, but I'm confused because shipping these cans requires additional packaging to prevent them from crashing together.  While I hate to knock Amazon in general, I must say that I'm disappointed that I have to trouble them with another phone call because the shipping facility couldn't figure out that adding more than just one deflated and flimsy plastic bag will prevent collisions in transit (odd, since the wonderfully packaged replacement shipment I've cited above -I think- came from the same place in Fernley, NV?!)."

I typically buy large containers of spice from Costco.  Costco has a very limited line and after running out of ginger, I was blown away by the supermarket prices for ginger -- typically five dollars for an ounce to an ounce and a half.  I was very pleased to find this product.  I use ginger frequently and you get twice as much product for what you would spend at the supermarket.  A low price doesn't mean much if the flavor is poor.  I was happy with the flavoring.  It yielded the flavor profile that I wanted.  I'm happy that the company sells other options like cilantro, which is a high-cost dried herb.  If you cook a lot with spices and herbs, I would consider this company.<br /><br />Note: If you want to save even more money, order directly from the company.  Google Marshalls Creek Spices to find more spices from this company.  The ginger on their website is under five dollars for six ounces but there is a higher shipping cost.  So this option is probably better for those that want several bottles of spices."

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

The thyme and chives were small but enjoyable, and I had given up on the parsley before it finally flourished and seasoned a few meals.<br /><br />But OH MY GOD DO I HAVE BASIL!  I've trimmed it aggressively many times, only to have it return bigger and bushier and beating out the other herbs for light.  I celebrated the fresh basil for a while, but now I stuff it unceremoniously into ziplocs and store it in the freezer until one day when it will all become pesto.<br /><br />Judging from mine and other reviewers' experiences, the aerogarden produces imperfect and unpredictable results -- but it has been fun to have fresh, growing herbs within my lightless apartment even if the outcome was not as planned.

Maltitol is an alcohol sugar and can be undigestible in the body.  You will know a short time after consuming it if you are one of the unsuspecting many who cannot digest it by the extreme intestinal bloating and cramping and massive amounts of gas a person can experience. Nausea, diarrhea & headaches can also be experienced. I learned my lesson the hard way years ago when I fell in love with the sugar-free chocolates suzanne sommers used to sell.  I thought I'd found sugar-free chocolate nirvana at first taste but the bliss was short lived when the terrible side effects of maltitol kicked in.  The discomfort was unlike anything I had ever felt before.  I blew up like a balloon and had very painful abdominal cramping.  As the symptoms passed, this too was very unpleasant.  Though hard for me to believe a low calorie sweetener could be the culprit, all symptoms were gone when I stopped eating the chocolate. My hunch it had something to do with the maltitol were unfortunately confirmed for me about a year later when I purchased some delicious sugar-free popcorn at my local market.  The taste was amazing and while I was looking at the label wondering what could possibly make this yummy, new sugarfree treat taste so good, my heart sank when I followed the little asterisk next to sugarfree sweetener* down to the very bottom of the label and read ""maltitol"" in tiny little letters! Thank goodness I'd eaten only a little. I still ended up with all the same side-effects but for a much shorter duration. Some people can use maltitol to their heart's content but others, like me, can have a bad reaction to it. In case you're like me, ... it's not you ...it's the maltitol!"

I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBV4"">Kettle Chips Honey Dijon</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."""

At first we thought there was something wrong with her, she wouldn't do normal crazy kitten things. After reading about cat nutrition, I discovered what I had fed to my cats as a kid was completely backwards, as is most 'cat food' even today. I read about BFF and decided to let her try some. Now my cat doesn't rest all day, but is playful and as crazy as a kitten should be. Also of note, there is much more urine in her litter box each day, which is a good sign of how much water is in the food. She's also volunteering her presence more now, not just when she is hungry. I had to take a star off, not because of the product, but since Amazon doesn't let me order more than 2 packs per flavor. I'd give it 6 stars if I could 'subscribe' as you can with other types of food on Amazon.<br /><br />Also, I would recommend the 3oz cans if you have only one cat. You will have to feed him/her more throughout the day, but it can dry out if they don't finish it, which defeats some of the purpose besides being unappetizing to the cat."

Custer,81,98,3,1333756800,Spectacular Brewing Failures but much less frequent (caffeinated only),"Something about the Brooklyn Bridge compelled me to try this product and - admittedly - I jump all over the K Cup spectrum trying each variety. I should also note that I'm hardly a coffee expert; even gas station coffee that has been sitting for two hours tastes fine to me. The ONLY reason I'd ever write a coffee review is if something about the packaging made life difficult and this is certainly the case here.<br /><br />On our first brew in the Keurig, coffee grinds were thrown out of the top of the machine and all over the counter. When we removed the pod, the foil had actually been shifted off of the base, creating about a half of an inch slit for grinds to be pushed out by the force of the water during the brewing cycle. To be fair, we tried three more pods and each exploded in their own, creative ways. On one , the hole created in the top was massive and allowed grinds to explode out of the container (I assume weak foil allowed the hole to grow during brewing. On another, for whatever reason, only an eighth of a cup of coffee was allowed out of the pod.<br /><br />OK - maybe our brewer needed cleaning or was in a state of disrepair? We put a pod of known good Timothy's in and the machine performed flawlessly.<br /><br />I'm assuming that in this first run of product, this coffee either missed on the specification for packing for the Keurig, used some bad materials, or perhaps both. But I'd steer clear for a while. I just tried to send these back but Amazon doesn't take returns on Grocery products. I'll be calling shortly to see what can be done. As is, these are useless and a pure waste of money.<br /><br />===Updated April 19, 2012===<br /><br />As you can see, Ruth from Brooklyn Bean Roastery Coffee used this thread to offer to replace my bad lots of coffee of which I had two, the Brooklyn Bridge Blend and the Decaf blend. I took her up on the offer, wrote her, gave my address, and indicated that I would change my review if warranted based on the results. Although I got no response to my email, two boxes of coffee showed up about a week later. So we put them to the test.<br /><br />The first box that I opened was the Brooklyn Bridge Blend. I tried four of the pods, and each worked without issue. The coffee was tasty enough but the real measuring stick for me was 'are there coffee grounds on my counter' and the answer in this case was no.<br /><br />Alas, we tried the Decaf. The first two pods immediately blew up during brewing. In one case, grounds came out of the coffee machine and in the other, grounds filled the coffee cup. In this case, the coffee failed my rather simple test criteria.<br /><br />The unfortunate thing is this company knew they were replacing bad batches of pods, had all the advanced warning that they needed to select a batch of known good quality, and we encountered the same issues as on our first purchase.<br /><br />I'm very appreciative of this company's efforts to make this right but my sense is that they have immature quality control processes and I cannot recommend this brand based on the higher than acceptable probability that you will end up with a bad batch.<br /><br />===Edit May 3, 2012===<br /><br />Ruth at Brooklyn Bean sent me a sample pack which contained seven different caffeinated flavors for me to try. I very much appreciate the efforts of this company to show their quality control processes have been fixed. I am not quite done with the entire sample pack but I wanted to post my progress for those interested.<br /><br />First, though, to Lisa Lou and others who may be thinking it, I am confident that I have ruled out machine error as a factor in my previous reviews. First, the machine was fully cleaned and de-scaled before testing and I have numerous ""known good"" pods from other suppliers that function flawlessly.<br /><br />That being said, I can say that these samples have performed very well. I have tested the following:<br /><br />4 Donut Shop<br />2 Cyclone<br />4 Boardwalk Blend<br />4 French Roast<br />1 Breakfast Blend<br />1 Columbian<br />1 Fuhgeddaboutit<br /><br />Of these 17, only one time (with a Boardwalk Blend) did the pod explode in the manner described in my review. It did explode fabulously - with grinds coming onto the counter and filling the internal unit (very hard to clean) - requiring a full cleaning of the machine. This happened only once, however, and this rate of failure isn't out of line with what I've experienced with other brands (they just fail in different ways - like grinds in the cup or a half full cup of coffee).<br /><br />I can say with reasonable confidence that the production issues are probably solved for the *caffeinated* flavors. I have no way of determining if the issues associated with the decaf have been solved.<br /><br />I am switching my rating to 3 Star given the spectacular (but more rare) nature of failures with this brand and given the uncertainty of the performance of the decaf variety.<br /><br />I hope this helps."

The time release allows for a longer absorption time over a period of a few hours and I can really tell the difference when I'm running around. The glutamine is helpful in muscle repair while the flax adds fiber which is essential and necessary omega 3 fatty acids. Whole strawberries and banana give needed vitamins, not to mention a really great flavor boost. I use frozen strawberries to give a nice chilled consistency to the shake as well as a way to keep a larger amount of strawberries handy.<br /><br />I stick to a plan of 4-5 meals a day, and this shake is great in helping make that happen. 2 Egg whites cooked for breakfast then a shake in the morning after the gym.. a couple of small meals and snacks throughout the day, and then a protein shake about an hour before bed.. eating or snacking every 2-3 hours. This is the way to go for me.<br /><br />Studies have shown that higher protein content in your stomach - as the last thing ingested, will keep you body from producing less insulin. This will in turn keep you from storing the food in your stomach as body fat, while kicking up your natural production of growth hormone. Growth hormone will create greater lean muscle mass and helps to put your body in a more anabolic state - so that you are burning your stomach contents as fuel all night long. You awaken ready to eat - already burning more calories to get your day going!<br /><br />This shake has been essential in keeping my muscle mass higher and leaner while allowing me to still keep the needed calories to not fade out during the day. It is not a intended to be a magic elixir ... but the balance of muscle vs. body fat is helped kept in check. I do 30 minutes of cardio 3x a week as well as 3o-40 minutes of resistance training on those days. So basically 3 hours a week of working out.<br /><br />Hope this helps you like it has helped me. Check out my other reviews on supplements I have added to my routine that I feel have been helpful as well."

When I received it, I was surprised to see that the main ingredients are, Petrolatum, Mineral Oil & Lanolin Wax. Not sure what to do with it, I googled it and found a video saying you should rub it into the scalp, which sounds like a bad idea to me - rubbing petroleum jelly, a sealant, into your scalp. Wouldn't that just clog everything up? I also found the company seems to have mounted a massive blogger campaign so that most of the search results were bloggers who have been given the product to review and are all ""hey, they gave me this to review, so you should consider going out and buying it"". I was hoping to find just somebody on a forum somewhere talking about the uses they found for the product or something, but no such luck.<br /><br />I finally figured maybe it could help the ends of my hair. I have fine, thin hair that is down past my bra strap and I recently used Color Oops on it four times over the course of about six weeks to try and remove henna buildup and the ends are looking a bit dry and raggedy, but I am loathe to lose any length. I finally caved and cut about an inch off the ends and then after washing and conditioning my hair and letting it dry about halfway I put a little of this balm on my fingers and smoothed it through the last maybe six inches of my hair. Since petroleum jelly is a sealant and the first/main ingredient in the product, I figure this will seal in moisture as well as any conditioner left on my hair from the shower. I've done this a few times now and it works pretty well. I've found that with this on the ends of my hair it curls more easily and the curls last longer than normal.<br /><br />The jar says ""Moisture Lock Nutrium 10(tm) With Shea Butter"", and I have no idea what that's supposed to mean, but I think they are referring to the last ten ingredients in the tub, the ones that come after ""fragrance"".<br /><br />I don't think I'd buy this again because 1.) this container will probably last for years! and 2.) I think it's a little pricey for a tub of mostly just Petrolatum, Mineral Oil and Lanolin Wax. Plus Lanolin Wax is a little gross in my opinion. It's a yellow waxy substance secreted by the sebaceous glands of wool-bearing animals. I have my own sebaceous glands, thanks."

They are practically weightless, and have an odd texture like a cross between a packing peanut and paperboard, with a dusty exterior.  For some reason, I keep thinking of a rice cake or a meringue cookie when I look at these.  This is not necessarily bad, it is just different.<br /><br />My schnauzer was more hesitant with this treat, I think it was due largly to the texture, as she is used to hard, crunchy stuff.  She took one big chomp and it crumbled, ending up as a pile of small pieces at her feet that she ate carefully, one or two at a time, until it was finished.<br /><br />The smell of these treats is appealing to me, actually.  We have the chicken variety.  Unlike some meat treats that seem to radiate with a salty, bouillion-cube-like scent, these have a subtle chicken soup-like fragrance.<br /><br />The package contains 4 oz., which works out to about 16 treats.  This is pricey compared to, say, Milkbones, but as a human who is willing to spend more for quality ingredients, I wouldn't call the cost outrageous, especially since I don't give these to my dog daily.<br /><br />I prefer treats that work my dog's instincts to gnaw and chew, and if her teeth get a bit of cleaning at the same time then I'm happy.  The Raw Boost Bites don't give her any of that.  However, as an occasional treat to give her something interesting and different, these are a fairly good option."

She's been looking for a healthier breakfast pastry for the kids since Pop-Tarts, while delicious, are not really all that great for you (with all the artificial colors, hydrogenated oils and such).  These organic pastries are really good and taste pretty much exactly like a Pop-Tart, they even look just like them.  I won't take that step and say that they taste `better', but they taste pretty much the same.  The Cherry Pomegranate flavor is really good, although I would have like more pomegranates.  Instead, I get a lot of cherry.  That is the only reason I give this four stars instead of five.  If you put a flavor on the box, you should represent that flavor well in the pastry and these should have merely been called `Cherry' because that is the only flavor I get.  Still, as a whole you can't go wrong with these Organic pastries.  They are more expensive than your typical Pop-Tarts, and you get less in a box as well, but for peace of mind as a parent they are worth it."

It's great for mixing with fresh berries, drinks like coffee and hot chocolate, and cereal. The taste is much sweeter than normal milk so kids usually really like it.

A lot like lemon, tart and astringent, but somehow moreso, it brings out other flavors and enhances them. Makes them more intense.  Sprinkle equal parts sumac, thyme and salt (the blend is called zaatar and used a lot in middle eastern cooking) on chicken before roasting and broiling and it brings out all the chicken flavor with just a hint of tanginess.<br /><br />One half a teaspoon sprinkled on scrambled eggs lifts them out of the category of breakfast standby and into a completely new echelon.  The pairing of smoked fish (lox or salmon, whitefish, sable or, especially, sturgeon) with sumac-enhanced scrambled eggs does things to the inside of the mouth that are probably illegal in some Red States.<br /><br />Run of the mill red caviar can be mixed with sour cream, a tiny amount of finely chopped chives and a big hit of sumac, then spread on a halved fingerling potatoes that have been sliced in half, drizzled with lots of olive oil and oven roasted until they have a good, crunchy crust. It's a combination of flavors and textures that's explodes with bright flavor. If you can never get too much salt, scatter some crisp bacon on top.  It's really salty, but really delicious.<br /><br />Any food that benefits from a squirt of lemon will be better with a little sumac.  Even lemonade is improved, especially if your lemons are dull and you want a really tart beverage.  Melt 1/2 cup sugar in hot water, pour it into a big pitcher. Add one teaspoon sumac, 1/4 tsp vanilla (super secret ingredient, tell no one), the juice of 4 lemons (don't squeeze too hard, you don't want sour oils from the skin ruining the taste), and enough filtered walter to fill up the pitcher. Chill and you have the iconic summer afternoon drink.<br /><br />Sumac is perfect with fish.  Sumac and ginger rubbed onto any white fish bring out the sweetness...this is especially lovely on catfish or those new fish like tilapia that have started appearing in the markets as the really good fish disappear or become too expensive.  Sumac and garlic are a brawnier pairing, good with fish, great with vegetables.  Sautee broccoli or spinach in olive oil with garlic, then sprinkle with sumac. Even veggie haters will think twice before saying no.  And added to home fries, sumac transforms diner food into something you'll want to serve with an expensive steak.  You can also rub sumac on steak to brighten the taste or add it to your usual dry rub or marinade.  And try it in chicken soup.  Just trust me on that one...you will want to throw a parade for me after tasting.  Experiment. Keep some in a dish on the table and sprinkle wherever you might have added lemon...on salads, in salad dressings for more that sharp lemony taste but less acid.<br /><br />If you need a quick lunch, salad or appetizer, this is a fast and easy go-to dish that takes five minutes to make and will please even people who (like me) consider salads more decorative than edible.  And if someone you invite to dinner sits down at the table and drops the bomb: ""But didn't you know I'm a vegan?"" you can dash to the kitchen and have it ready to slide under that persnicity little snoot in two minutes.<br /><br />Spiced Tomatoes on Exotic Bread<br />2 Tablespoons dried thyme<br />1 Tablespoon sumac<br />2 teaspoons sesame seeds, toasted<br />1/2 teaspoon table salt<br />1 pint cherry or grape tomatoes (or regular if you don't have the little ones. Why sweat the small stuff)<br /><br />In a small container with a lid, shake together the zaatar...thyme, sumac, sesame seeds and salt. If you don't have sesame seeds, it's okay. It will still taste good, just not as good.  The combination, with or without the seeds is called 'zaatar,' which is Arabic for ""Can I have some more, please.""<br /><br />Cut each of the cherry tomatoes in half (if using whole tomatoes, dice them and let a little of the juice drain away, you don't want this too liquidy), sprinkle with about one tablespoon of the zaatar.  Stir it all together, then taste. You don't want it too salty.  Add more zaatar if necessary, tasting as you go.  The tomatoes will make this very juicy. Serve with lots of toasted naan, pita, lavash, or any middle eastern flatbread that's fun to dip/sop.  I've served it with corn tortillas and it was good. I think it would be great with toasted french bread or garlic bread.  It is so good, you forget it's made of vegetables.<br /><br />Oh, wait a minute: I forgot tunafish.  One can of tuna, one tablespoon each mayo and plain yogurt (please, not that scary plastic looking non fat stuff, use the real thing). One big tablespoon of sumac. Stir lightly so the tuna stays lumpy. Pile it on top of toasted rye bread or a rye krisp, open-faced, and scatter chives on top.  It's just tuna, takes no more time than the same old same old, but it tastes much better, plus it's festive.<br /><br />Enjoy."

Servings are typically divided into just one or two cookies. Two cookies contain about 100 calories, 24 g carbohydrates and 14 g sugars. The calorie breakdown is over 90% carbohydrates, mostly from sugars. This is a BIG red flag. No one should consume junk like this. Don't be misled by the ""Fat Free"" label. (see second paragraph) Refined sugars are far, far worse for dieters than fats are; poly- and monounsaturated fats are in fact beneficial, and calories from fat provide more stable energy. With the exception of trans and saturated fats, (they raise bad cholesterol) you really shouldn't be on a low-fat diet. Sugars are the worst thing for dieters, as they aren't as likely to be metabolized as energy, and will typically be stored as body fat. (mostly around the mid-section) High-fructose corn syrup (an ingredient in SnackWell's products) is specifically linked with an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. The human body simply is not meant to metabolize this much sugar, nor sugars that are unnaturally processed. I can't provide links to research on the subject, because Amazon has rather ridiculous policies that censor URLs, names of other sites, stores, competitors, etc. from reviews. Be sure to complain to Amazon.com about this practice. Still, it's easy enough to open a search engine and type ""snackwell devil food nutrition facts"" or the like.<br /><br />Bear in mind that products are not required to declare nutritional content when the servings are divided into small portions, and the content would be less than 0.5 g. Each cookie actually contains 0.17 g saturated fat, which Nabisco neglects to mention. Trans fat content is entirely unaccounted for, though it may actually exist. This means that ""Fat Free"" claim was just a blatant lie. Will anyone hold Nabisco responsible for unscrupulously deceiving consumers, though? Can anyone demand that they pull misleading products off the shelf? Nope. Welcome to corporate America.<br /><br />Don't let Nabisco and other ""health-conscience"" snack companies scam you. Read labels closely, and be suspicious of small servings. If a single serving contains less than 0.5 g trans fat, then it doesn't have to be declared; the label will inaccurately specify 0 g. If the portions seem ridiculously small, then it's safe to assume they're trying to hide something from the consumer.<br /><br />On a side note, please ignore ""helpful review"" ratings. Re-distributors of products will often vote down critical reviews, because they demote the very products they're trying to sell on Amazon. It's all politics."

What captured my attention so firmly?  What makes this coffee so great?<br /><br />It is unusual simply because: (1) It is 100% Arabica; (2) It is 100% Colombian.  (3) It is roasted by the French.  There is only one other coffee with this particular rare pedigree, and it is good, but not quite as good as Carte Noire.  Amazon's ad terminology calls this an after dinner coffee.  I disagree with them.  We have always used it exclusively in the morning, as do the Europeans who value its rich taste.<br /><br />This coffee is bold but not overpowering.  It avoids giving you a thin or a bitter coffee taste.  One package of 250 grams (very finely ground) will last for exactly five days when brewed in a 12-cup pot.  My coffee philosophy is this:  If you're going to drink coffee, buy and drink the best one you can find anywhere.  This is it.  I wouldn't lie about something this important."

This yeast strain was developed by the Sierra Nevada Brewing Company, and is what is used to ferment Sierra Nevada Pale Ale among many other beers. The Wyeast ""smack pack"" is a great delivery system for yeast.  After smacking the pack to burst the inner pouch of nutrients, the rate and amount the whole thing inflates tells you how active and viable the yeast is.  Quite an effective system and I can't say enough how much I respect Wyeast products.<br /><br />I have used this particular yeast strain extensively as a home brewer and find it to be great choice for almost any kind of american style ale in which you want to showcase the flavors of the hops or malt used instead of focusing on flavors derived from the fermentation process itself. Wyeast 1056 works exceptionally well in hoppy beers like pale ales, India pale ales, and double/imperial IPAs, as well as American interpretations of amber ales, stouts, porters, etc.  It has pretty good alcohol tolerance (higher even than what Wyeast reports, I believe).  Some say this yeast doesn't flocculate very well but I have found that is not a problem so long as the finished beer is left in the refrigerator undisturbed in a keg or bottle for a week or two.<br /><br />All in all this is a superstar yeast that everyone should consider a staple in their brewing arsenal.

The brown sugar is more of the background base flavor that one would expect to taste, and the blueberry gives it the flavor mixture that really makes these a pleasure to eat!

It is not too strong, so I could eat a whole package without getting tired of the flavor, and yet each cracker has enough flavor that I can eat just one and be pleased.<br /><br />Newton's Fruit Thins are a delightful snack, with a perfect blend of maple sugar and blueberry flavoring.

I chose the sweet tea flavor because I knew that flavor would be easy to compare to other no-calorie powdered drinks. I am a big fan of the Walmart version of Crystal Light (Walmart's is less expensive and better tasting than CL).<br /><br />The delivery method is a great idea. You can adjust the amount depending on the glass size or your mood, it can go into a water bottle just as easy, it's convenient to carry, great for camping, at the office or whenever you don't want to make a whole pitcher of drink mix or don't like the taste of your tap water.<br /><br />The flavor is FANTASTIC. Better than any sugared or non-sugared powder mix! The cost for such a small bottle seems expensive, but it is super concentrated, excellent flavor, you'll drink more water than ever before, well worth the price when you compare it to bottled water or other drinks."

I can't even tell from drinking that it contains kale, beet, spinach, carrots, and tomatoes.  The 16g of protein per asceptic container is perfect and ideally sized.<br /><br />I purchase at least 5-6 cases of Orgain a month, because I drink 2-3 a day.  At least 1 as a post-workout shake, and the others as meal supplements.  Orgain also helps me stay awake at night for evening classes, and are more preferable to consuming Red Bull or 5-hour energy drinks.  I credit Orgain (along with a healthy diet) for helping me lose weight and pursue my fitness goals.<br /><br />Big fan of the sweet vanilla and chocolate flavors, was hoping to try the Cafe Mocha flavor, but Amazon didn't offer any with Prime shipping...until now!  The coffee flavor is delicious; there's a slight coffee-ish aftertaste, but I like it.  Its flavor profile lies somewhere between the more neutral vanilla and the stronger chocolate flavors.  There's also no caffeine in the Mocha varieties.  Unlike the vanilla flavor, I'm happy to report that the Mocha flavors do not seem prone to  whey protein aggregation.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and grab a Cafe Mocha Orgain!

But it could be way better.<br />-This thing is made from wine vinegar and cooked grape must that's mixed together<br />-Its NOT aged so it lacks that distinct earthy, woody aroma that you associate with a good balsamic vinegar<br />-It has 5 grams of sugar per tablespoon or 20 calories but you can barely taste the sweetness<br />-It tastes more like a red wine vinegar or even rice vinegar - light, fruity and fresh and has an acidic after taste similar to eating a lemon. In good quality aged balsamic vinegars you wont notice this high acidic aftertaste and it will be more sweet and mellow to the palate. Not this one. Overall this may be an OK vinegar for salad dressings but not so great for using it as a dip with olive oil. But its cheap and definitely not a total rip off."

The color is a yellow, maybe a copper tone---nothing like gold. I used part of this for an anniversary cake--I had to drive to the arts and crafts store to purchase Wiltons Gold shimmer to attempt to cover this disaster. I thought $15 was pretty expensive in the first place, but after using the product I am sure it is not worth a single cent. I cannot believe how grotesque this color is.

They were absolutely NOT interested at all.  The next time we tried they carried them around in their mouths for a minute or so, and decided, for some reason, that they were inedible.  However, the third try must have been when they were REALLY hungry because they appeared more interested. But this is more like rawhide than a ""treat"". Our dogs really had to work on this for a long time. Our younger dog, a Shih Tzu did okay and after about 15 minutes was making headway on eating it.  Our elderly Japanese Chin who is 14 (that's 98 in dog years) was  much more fussy.

Keep in mind that these other foods (with the exception of Science Diet, Iams, and other big store brands) are also very healthy for your pet and are loaded with high quality ingredients. I personally feed my cats Health Extension because it's the best food you can get for the price. However, if you want the absolute best, this is it.<br /><br />A look at the first four ingredients will tell you why. They're all ""meals"", which is essentially meat that has been ground up and dehydrated to around 10 percent moisture as opposed to 75 percent. Some fats are also removed because meat this compressed would have too high a fat percentage otherwise. Though ""meals"" do often contain other part of the animal humans wouldn't consider ""meat"", it doesn't matter to cats or dogs and is actually more nutritious. This food also contains rabbit organs, a few fruits and vegetables, and two different kinds of probiotics.<br /><br />As for taste, I just opened a sample bag and gave some dry food to my cats.

Who knows. Most of us aren't going to spend the money to buy the equipment to test it. (And that's not even getting into the company's interesting claim that the water is 'too pure' to test with cheap litmus paper. If the water were pure, the pH would be 7. All the fun chemicals they add to change the pH necessarily make it no longer pure.)<br /><br />What i can say is, whatever the pH was, it made no impression on a mild case of heartburn, the kind that can be knocked out with one or two chewable antacid tablets. I didn't feel more hydrated after 1.5 liters of this than i'd feel after 1.5 liters of any other water.<br /><br />The taste? Water. I drink a lot of water, mostly straight tap water, sometimes filtered with a standard filter pitcher, and every once in a while from a pre-packaged bottle of water when i plan badly and my reusable bottle runs dry. Essentia wasn't noticeably different.<br /><br />There are a lot of websites out there that promise all sorts of health benefits for drinking high pH water. There are even some people with an MD after their name that back up the claims. But that's the great thing about the internet: there's a website for everything, and often someone with a fancy degree swearing it's all true.<br /><br />So if you want to pay a pile of money for water that is, at its core, tap water with some stuff filtered out and other stuff added in, that's your business.

500714,500715,B000LQLV3S,A1DY4VSIUS1ZKN,M. Patient,7,8,5,1322438400,As good as a bagged chunk of noodles and mysterious powder can be,"I've been eating Nong Shim Neoguri for about 20 years... I was introduced to it in high school by a Korean student, and I've been slurping them ever since.  Back in those days, a case of 20 at the local Korean market was $7.  Now, they're $20+ on Amazon.  Still worth it though.<br /><br />There are really three things going on in the package:<br /><br />- The noodles: The heavy buckwheat Udon-style noodles have superior flavor and texture compared to ramen and other instant noodles.<br /><br />- The soup base: Very salty, very (red) peppery.  Not too complex, but tasty, and if you want complex from a bag of instant noodles, you might need to adjust your expectations.<br /><br />- The seaweed: I don't like seaweed, but I like this.  I don't know why that is.<br /><br />Because I like spicy, I typically use much less water than called for (I use about 1-2 cups depending on how brave I'm feeling) to produce almost more of a sauce that coats the noodles than a soup.  In my opinion, these noodles are at their best if you can eat them with a fork and still have minimal broth left over when you're done.  You may want to bring Tums to that party though.<br /><br />These are, in my opinion, as good as it gets in the instant noodle market.  I.e. they are five-star instant noodles, not five-star food.<br /><br />Downsides: The sodium and saturated fat are really high, if I still ate these like I did when I was 18, I'd be dead by now (37).  Also, merely reading the list of chemicals involved out loud may cause an allergic reaction in organic eaters.  I harbor a dim suspicion that ingesting enough would varnish one's insides in a way that may be of interest to anyone interested in bringing mummification back into fashion."

That gives a very nice real bacon flavor to anything you put it on.<br /><br />So when I received the package, I couldn't wait to open it and try it on some food. What a disappointment ! It tastes like salt and MSG with yeast flavoring... not close to a nice bacon experience. I tried it on a sandwich, veggies, etc.... still a far cry from a nice bacon taste. Just salt and MSG...

You then take a 8 inch ovenproof skillet or square pan (we use a cast iron skillet...a very, very old one), and spray it with a no-sick cooking spray and stick the pan in a preheated oven (425 degrees) for 7 to 8 minutes.<br /><br />You then combine the cornbread mix, mild and egg in a small mixing bowl, stir until smooth and dump it in the skillet.  Bake at 425 degrees for 18 to 22 minutes until golden brown.<br /><br />That is it!<br /><br />This particular cornbread has a wonderful consistency and a very (I stress ""very"") mild pepper flavor as it dose have Jalapeno peppers added...one of my favorites of the pepper family.  To be honest, I have never tasted anything quite like it.  It easily reaches the category of comfort food.  I actually defy you to eat just one chunk and quite.

I read previous reviews and had also noticed the chicken and apple treat became a quarter size with a very black chicken wrap and me like a dummy gave it to him anyway. 6 months later of my dog vomiting, bloody diarrhea extreme weight loss we started prednizone as it was the last resort, either that or they wanted to operate saying it was a thickening intestinal wall that was stopping food from passing but couldn't guarantee this would work. I so now in my heart believe is was due to Dogswell products. I started ordering them again just 2 months ago, noticed the treats were back to normal looking like they used to look, thought nothing strange of it and starting giving it to him again but being still on prednizone it's hard to say if any further damage was now done. I am stopping the purchase of these treats and throwing the rest away. I wanna thank the public for your reviews and it has helped me so much understand maybe what has been going on with my baby. Sure enough after reading everything and did a google search I ran downstairs to check my bags and sure enough it said made in CHINA, I nearly passed out, This is a huge eye opener for me and from now on I will be buying only homemade dog treats made from people I know and my treats from stores like ""THREE DOG BAKERY"" here in Las Vegas, Nevada were I now will know what my dog is getting. This country has purely gone to shit and this sickens me that my baby suffered due to greed once again. Let's fight back and NEVER EVER buy anything with the label ""MADE IN CHINA"" I don't care what it is or how great a deal it is, this must be stopped some how as it seems everything is being made in China, please help the fight, you and your dogs life depends on it.

My son can not eat wheat or dairy, and he absolutely loves these little bars.  They have made a wonderful, irreplaceable breakfast bar, or snack for the car.  We also order cases of Enjoy Life granola and chocolate chips on a regular basis.  So this review is coming from someone who REALLY likes their products.  Fast forward to 3 1/2 weeks ago: we go onto Amazon and see that the bars have been changed to a ""new recipe.""  This really worried my son, but we ordered a case and anxiously awaited their arrival.  The bars came and EVERY single one was covered in GREEN, FUZZY mold.  Yes, we opened each and every bar in the whole case!!  So, instead of calling Amazon, I called the company direct, feeling like they should know about this asap.  I talked to a representative from the company and she said that they already knew about the mold, but it had been too late and a few cases were sent to customers.  She said that they would send a replacement case asap.  I was so happy and figured that we could expect the new bars in a few days. 3 wks passed and I realized we hadn't received the new case.  Sent a long email to the company telling them how disappointed I was and after a few days I got a one line email saying the case would ship today.  No explanation, no apology, nothing.  So, I won't hold my breath about the replacement, and I sincerely hope this company works on their public relations skills.  (I wouldn't have even written this email if someone just admitted that they had ""dropped the ball"" and apologized)  The allergy community definitely needs good brands and hopefully this one will improve."

And you can't really over brew it to release off-flavors as there is so little to the leaves. I find this tea works best for iced tea, it works well cold and has a much more refreshing flavor that other teas do on a summer day.<br />Of course there are there is the added benefit that it is good for you.

Among the foods we've fed him are similar pouch-style packets where you can squeeze the puree right into their mouths. Directions also say that you can squeeze it onto a spoon, but for me, if I'm using a packet, it's for convenience and I'm not wanting to bother with a spoon (or washing up afterwards).<br /><br />We've tried a number of different flavors and brands, so I jumped at the opportunity to try this new brand from Amazon Vine. The Juicy Pear and Garden Greens pouch tastes similar to one of the Plum Organic flavors, Spinach, Pea and Pear, although the Baby Gourmet is sweeter. Pear is by far the strongest flavor.<br /><br />My son was lukewarm on the taste. We've gone through 4 packets; it's taken 2 meal sittings (he gets other food along with it) for each packet. He normally loves just plain steamed broccoli and fresh pears, so I was surprised at his lack of enthusiasm. While he doesn't immediately push it away, he doesn't point to the bag to request it, either. However, it's definitely something an adult could eat; it is a pleasant enough taste experience. I have one at my desk as part of my emergency stash.<br /><br />Like other pouched food, the convenience can't be beat. It can be squeezed right in their mouths; no silverware needed. The cap is easy to screw off and screw back on. They are super easy to pack (we've used them on many long-haul flights) and you don't have to worry about the bag breaking. I like that it's organic.<br /><br />It loses an additional star for the nozzle placement and for price. I found the position of the nozzle to be a little odd: most packets have their food nozzle at the top. It makes getting the product out easier, in addition to not having a large flap of container to navigate when feeding a wiggly toddler. In terms of pricing, there are other similarly sized and quality products out there for better prices (and they are also organic purees). The quality and taste of the Baby Gourmet were not high enough to be worth the extra cost.<br /><br />I will keep these on my radar, however, and if the price becomes competitive, I would definitely consider buying them."

Nice to see a fair representation OUTside the box of what is INside, though, unlike many ('not actual size') products!<br /><br />2- the standard rectangular graham cracker size has been halved into two separate squares.<br /><br />3- the paper packages that contain stacks of graham crackers contain fewer squares than the 'regular' packaging.

If you put bark mulch, lawn clippings and a little bit of manure in a blender with milk and drank it - that might be a close comparison to the taste of this stuff, in my humble opinion.  I can't even believe I spent money on these, or that anyone else does.  Maybe if you're one of those people who drinks wheatgrass or eats carob like it's really chocolate, or one of those other ""healthy"" and a way too earthy concoctions, you'll like it.  If you have normal tastebuds, run - don't walk -  the other way from this stuff."

He would come downstairs every morning and sit in front of the pantry until someone gave him his Greenies. He also learned to do all sort of cute tricks. We taught him these tricks with Greenies as his incentive. These treats were healthy for him, never made him sick, and made his breath smell good. I would only give him one Greenies a day and to spread that one Greenie out over the entire day, I would take pliers and cut it into 6-8 little pieces. Seemed like my dog would feel more fulfilled to have little pieces throughout the day versus one whole Greenie once a day. Once I discovered Greenies, I cut all the other treats out and really only have him the Greenies. The 27oz. tub was in my opinion a really good value for the money so I would always buy that size.

I started using this shortly after the pet food recalls in 2007.  The lack of Grains, and real meat (not the processed kind you find in the grocery store), is what promotes the health of your pet carnivore.<br /><br />While there are some veggies, the smell will tell you the amount of meat in this product.  I supplement with one serving from <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0012PZ7U0"">Holistic Select Feline Radiant Adult and Kitten Health Chicken Meal Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3-Pound Bag</a>.<br /><br />The cats ages range currently from 7 to 17.  The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.  If you can't afford heavy vet bills, put your pets on this and some money into savings, in lieu of the overpriced pet insurance.<br /><br />With the free shipping, it is still a deal.<br /><br />Edit: I've added to the review after it appeared Product Not Available.

I probably do not require much if any of the supplements in this mix, but a little extra(and this mix will not overload you with potentially unhealthy non-soluble vitamins like certain pills might), is probably beneficial.  I do not normally use much if any acai, goji or seaweed related nutrients in cooking or smoothies, so I appreciate that some of those are in this mix as well.<br /><br />The mix is 100% vegan and organic, and my impression is that the ingredients are ethically sourced which is important to me. . .some are even grown stateside.  I believe this company sources its organic wheatgrass, for example, from Kansas.<br /><br />On the downside, the apparent quality and organic nature of the ingredients lead to a somewhat costly mix, and the 60 servings in this particular size will go fairly quickly if you rely on this as a central supplement in your diet.  Also, while some vegetarians and healthy eaters might enjoy the taste of this item by itself in water or some other mix - taste is largely learned, and if you are just starting to transition to a healthier diet from a more traditional diet this item is likely going to taste strange and potentially unappealing.  I recommend adding it to a pre-existing smoothie recipe (probably the best option for new healthy eaters - but make sure your smoothie is healthy too, or you are defeating the purpose) or sprinkling it on some other foodstuff.  Do not cook it into foods though, or you will lose many of the nutrients.  Also, refrigeration is recommended.  I do not even notice the taste when it is added to something else.  By itself, it would no doubt be distinctive.  I do not know why this company is advertising this particular blend as great tasting on its own - that is not a good approach for a mix of this kind.  On the other hand, this company does carry a berry and chocolate flavored blend (and the flavorings truly appear to be ""natural"") that may prove more palatable to those with pickier taste buds who just want to mix it in water, soymilk or some other beverage."

The splash of green on red sauces, fresh veggies, and other dishes is a treat for the eye as well as the palette. A little salty and acidic, it goes great with finished Mexican dishes if you want to kick them up, as well as in soups, beans, chili, and added to salsa when you think it needs a little heat. This sauce is not incredibly hot as some are (the kind that work better as dares, really, or can only be taken in a very diluted form), but it's not for the babies either.<br /><br />It's just right for most people who like some spice, and putting it on the table lets you make milder dishes, and let the individual diners decide how spicy they want it; likewise, it helps you make those Mexican dishes spicier and tastier if you want to cook with the sauce. The price is great--just over a dollar per bottle, but the large quantity works better for restaurants than individual use."

These chews did an excellent job keeping his teeth clean, but were not as effective with his gums.  I am really looking forward to getting him back on these chews so that at least his teeth will be healthy.  We have to wait for his allergy tests to come back to find out what he is allergic to.  As soon as we get the green light from our vet, I am going to put him back onto the chews.  I would recommend them to any cat owner looking to improve his or her cat's teeth."

I felt safe when I ate them; the ingredients are gluten free and organic eggs, butter, cocoa paste, chocolate chunks and sugar.  This definitely should be a helpful and fun snack for many who must eliminate wheat, gluten and dairy.  I couldn't taste much of the coconut but there is never enough coconut for me!"

I am a tea lover and I drink both loose teas and bag teas.  This looked almost too good to be true for the price, but I thought, ""What the heck?""  I found that 1 bag will only steep one cup of tea.  You cannot get 2 cups like you can out of many other brands.  I also found that some bags did not want to steep at all.  Also, the string tends to come off easily.  The strings appear to be sealed into the bag and when they get into a boiling cup of water, they tend to come off and the top of the bag opens and the tea leaves come out.  Ok, but I wouldn't give it as a gift or anything.  I suggest sticking with a better brand for bagged teas like Lipton, Bigelow, or Celestial Seasonings.

They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store.<br /><br />I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie.  In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion.<br /><br />Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me.<br /><br />This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber.<br /><br />While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar.<br /><br />Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either."

In front of them on the table are sheets, maps that will help you through an imaginary dungeon laid out so that the prisoner monsters are running free in a labyrinth, oddly shaped dice, pencils and lots of paper. If there are women at the table, they are out numbered by men. They are drinking their Mountain Dew, and empowered to be the most powerful mages, thieves and clerics you've ever met. This is serious business, and Mountain Dew, with it's higher than average for a soda amount of caffeine is what these adventurers need to prove how great they are. It's liquid magic, it's the fuel for great things.<br />It's Mountain Dew! You can't be a good sorcerer without Mountain Dew!

At the time, it was called Patak's Brinjal Aubergine (or Bringal Pickle Aubergine in some markets).<br /><br />When the company transferred across the Atlantic, the new owners chose to abandon this little gem in favor of Patak's other chutney's and mint pastes -- all of them terrific. But for me, it was like losing a best friend. Talk about COMFORT food... I called the new owners at least once a year begging for a return of ambrosia.<br /><br />For me, it was like trying to break a drug addiction, but in this case, there was no methadone in site. It's difficult to describe a flavor in a text review, but let me try...<br /><br />Some of us like our pastes, sauces and relishes *HOT*. (This one is modestly rated as ""medium""). But when recipes add chili or other heat, it is far too easy to drop the ball on the other flavors. Would you like some sweet, spicy & natural flavors dancing amongst the tangy heat? Do want a flavor that makes you close your eyes and praise the designer for giving you a tongue? If this describes you, then this is as close to paradise as it gets. Next, let's talk about VERSATILE. I spread this baby on everything (the word ""spread"" requires artistic license. Some firm eggplant chunks are as big as your little finger!)<br /><br />Do you have to be Indian to eat this relish? Heck no! I'm a mid-west raised, New England Yankee. But this little jar of heaven has become one of my raison's d'etre (Translation: ""reasons for existence""). To be fair, you have to love Indian or Mediterranean spice. It's loaded with chili, fenugreek, coriander, mustard and turmeric -- and especially fresh garlic (definitely not roasted or denatured!). And of course, it has just the right amount of heat. The basic flavor component is a bit like fermented raisins or rum w/raisin, though I doubt that there is any alcohol.<br /><br />Verdict: 6 out of 5 stars. (That's not a mistake.

The taste is very mild in the original form.  I have used it in frying things like french fries and chicken patties and find that it gives a less greasy product and a crispier product in comparison to frying with olive oil. I did not like using it with things like eggs, as there is the slightest residual coconut taste.  I have used it as a substitute in baking cookies, cakes, yeast breads, and quick breads and find the texture preferable to oil and even butter with no coconut after taste.  Would highly recommend this product and will definitely continue to purchase."

After the poisonous wheat glutten incident I had to stop feeding him those cuts and gravy style foods because all of them contain wheat glutten. Even if they are not contaminated I still feel uneasy about it. So I research all of the web and found this unique food. It's not available in regular stores so you have to go to their website to find specialty stores that carry them. Anyway, I was so happy to see that my cat loves this food, both the dried and the mushy canned version. I now feed him 1 can of EVO wet food and some dried EVO kibbles plus low-sodium chicken stock (he won't drink plain water) each day. It's been 3 months since I switched his food and he still seems to love it. In fact, he's getting FAT on this diet because I over fed him (he asks for food whenever I go to the kitchen, and he gives me that sad look so I feel guilty if I don't feed him). I am starting to cut down on his ration and minimize my trip to the kitchen. I also hope the cooler weather will encourage him to go out more and burn off those extra calories.<br />I read a lot about benefits of this food but honestly only my cat knows. His fur is very soft but not really shiny (don't remember if it was ever shiny). Don't know about litter box odor because he goes outside.

After I eat the cookie, the aftertaste is actually a bit noxious.<br /><br />I also requested a different flavor from this brand, and surprisingly, they taste great.  These simply don't.  I love chocolate chip cookies, but perhaps I'm spoiled because I bake a lot.  These are simply too processed and sweet for me.  And I'm no snob.  I love cheap junk food.<br /><br />They are chewy, and they are filled with some kind of super sweet frosting, but it's just too darn sweet.  Makes my teeth hurt just thinking about it.  Also, when I cleaned out my desk I discovered one of these cookies had fallen out of my lunch bag a few weeks before.  It probably spent five weeks in the open air, and yet it was identical to a fresh cookie from the original package.  No bugs had touched it.  It hadn't dried out.

We sampled them straight up / neat, one at a time.  The best of the lot was the Karlsson Gold.  Yes, it was a tasting sponsored by Karlsson, but it had a good selection of other vodkas, including one we had been buying, but I was impressed enough that we bought a bottle to enjoy at home.<br /><br />The flavor from the Swedish potatoes is quite good.  There is more flavor than just the vaguely sweet flavor I find in vodka.

It makes a delicious meal for nights when actual cooking is just too much to face, but you still want to eat well (though the portions in one box are a bit skimpy for two persons, unless you add extra veggies to the Mutter Paneer sauce).<br /><br />The Basmati Pilau Rice packet cooks beautifully in the microwave, as does the Mutter Paneer (either at the same time, or -- when I want to add some fresh vegetables to take advantage of all that sauce -- poured over vegetables in a dish before 'nuking').  I've also tried sauteing extra vegetables on the stovetop and then pouring the sauce packet over them to heat up at the last, which offers more control over the doneness of all ingredients.  I favor the frying pan method, except for when washing the pan afterwards still seems like too much work.<br /><br />Strict vegetarians might want to take care, though:  there's no meat listed in the ingredients, but it always seems to me that there are a few shreds of chicken meat (or something very like it) in the Pilau."

We use exactly half as much of this coffee as our regular coffee to make the same amount and it's plenty strong.  This is coffee AND chicory, so those who tell you they don't like Chicory coffee, may not have had this particular brand.  It is delicious!  We have made it several ways- french press, hot drip, and cold brew.  Cold brew is our favorite, then french press, and hot drip.  Of course, that is true of every brand of coffee we buy.  (If you haven't tried cold brew, you don't know what you are missing!)  Anyway, if you like strong flavorful coffee without too much bitterness or oil, this is a great one.

Remember, this is only pancake/waffle mix; there are no exotic ingredients  in it; basically an unbleached flour with a few other small things.  Bottom line, it's a very good product, but so is Carbon's.  The key seems to be getting the right waffle maker (I have been talking about waffles the whole time here); I just spent another hundred bucks on another waffle maker (a Waring 300), and from what I have read, this unit is supposed to produce a better quality waffle, all else being equal.

The stuff in the grocery store is reportedly 30,000 SKU or less and this powder knocks what I have bought in the past, out of the park.<br /><br />I bought this mainly for cayenne's rich health benefits and am making a tincture with it as well as eating 3tsps a day. Cayenne pepper especially at 90,000 SKU can really help lower your blood pressure, improve circulation, stop profuse bleeding, gives energy, increases metabolism, can stop a heart attack in its tracks, and many other benefits. Google it if you don't believe it, some see it as one of the most beneficial foods to cook with and have in your house. Anyways enough homeopathic babble.....<br /><br />Bottom line is this stuff has GREAT flavor much better than other store bought kinds I have purchased and really packs the heat! I put half a table spoon in my chicken noodle soup as I have done in the past with store bought brands and boy did I regret it haha if you don't have a heat tolerance and are taking this as a daily supplement I would suggest starting with 1/8 of a tea spoon in 8ozs of warm water and working your way up to 1 tsp 3 times daily for max effects. In comparison to fresh pepper heat I would rather nibble down a habanero or Thai dragon chili both ranking around 100,000 SKU than a table spoon of this stuff like I did in my soup, not to say its bad cayenne but just that a little powder goes a long ways and that's what makes this such a GREAT deal!<br /><br />If you are looking to spice up dishes, watch out for your health, or use it for any number of other uses then this is the cayenne for you. This stuff is HOTTTT and you will not be disappointed or find a hotter cayenne pepper powder for this price on Amazon!"

More effective and absorptive than tablet form, Natural CALM is the best selling ionic magnesium supplement to be found in health food stores to date. Choose natural or one of four flavored varieties. It's all the same healthful Natural CALM.<br /><br />Magnesium is also attributed to curing or moderating all of the following conditions: leg cramps, headaches, hair loss, insomnia, high blood pressure, nervousness, muscular disorders and depression. That is not to say that any or all of these conditions are apt to be remedied in each and every case. Pardon me, but I had to laugh when reading one reviewer's comment that said the product helped her leg cramps but didn't do anything for her sleeplessness. She readily awarded the product a mediocre three stars.<br /><br />Holistic alternatives are of utmost importance, especially--especially as we advance in years. I highly recommend this gluten-free product. You might be surprised at how little you require. Starting with half a teaspoon daily you increase or decrease as might be necessary. Soon you discover your proper dosage.<br /><br />Directions are unclear as to the amount of water to be used: ""Place powder in a glass or mug,"" it says. ""Add 2-3 oz of hot water. Let it fizz, then stir until dissolved. Fill with warm or cold water and enjoy. You can also simply add Natural CALM to a glass or bottle of cold water.""<br /><br />Got it? Neither do I. It's confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide.<br /><br />Then there's the problem with this two-inch wide container. The size and shape may be suitable for stacking on store shelves, but not for home use. You need something wider. Consequently, I transfer the contents into something more sensible. Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy.<br /><br />Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary. I stir and let it settle. Then down the hatch.<br /><br />Need I mention that Natural CALM contains no yeast, dairy, egg, soy, wheat, sugar, starch, preservatives, artificial color or flavors? No fructose added. For further information call customer service at (866) 416-9216.<br /><br />Take charge of your health. Live life to the fullest."

I prefer to feed my cat wet food since it's healthier for them, but she's a ""grazer"" during the day, which doesn't work well with wet food. I don't feel bad about giving her a scoop of this in the morning to munch on throughout the day though. The six pound bag lasts her around two months at 1/2-3/4 cup per day. The reduced calorie type is great for her since she's an indoor kitty, and she seems to love the flavor. She's seven years old now and so far has been incredibly healthy plus maintains a normal weight. We always get comments on how soft and beautiful her coat is, and I think it has a lot to do with giving her higher quality food."

I have a long mane of fine and frizzy hair that is a pain to wash, a pain to comb out and usually requires a quarter of a bottle of shampoo simply to work up a lather.  With this shampoo, a quarter sized amount of creamy shampoo (not gloppy or watery) sufficed for the entire mass of hair, quickly working up a lather.  Being a mom on the go, it's been a while since I considered washing my hair anything other than something to get over with as quickly and with as  little soap as possible (to avoid drying out my skin and hair).  This shampoo turns showering back into a bit of a luxury.  I actually enjoy lathering up my hair, and my skin and scalp do not become dried out or itchy from the product.<br /><br />My budget really isn't up to affording salon level hair care, so having something this good for a reasonable price is a definite plus.  My hair has seen definite improvement, from the shampoo alone (I have to see about getting some conditioner in the same line).  Normally, combing out the tangles from my hair after a shower takes a good fifteen minutes of frustration, pain and endless snarls.  My hair tends to feel sticky and wraps around the brush or comb until I have to pull hair out of my head to free it.  Not so with this shampoo.  My combing out time was cut in half and while I did have a few snarls in my middle-of-the-back length hair, they were minor ones that came right out with a few tugs of the comb.  My hair is less frizzy, has more shine and feels a lot less dried out than it does when I've used other shampoo.  The containers are also well thought out.  They stand easily on the tub corners, or in the shower baskets.  The pop out dispenser means I can flip up the lid and flip it down again with no worries the pop up will snap off and no extra mess.  Containers are easy to handle and visually appealing.<br /><br />Definitely will be looking for this one in the future! It's a winner!<br />^_^ Shanshad"

Everybody who has gotten to the point of good intelligence regarding managing their intake of food should be aware how to use good fats vs bad fats, good carbs vs bad carbs but this IS, in my estimation, a very healthy product and just as you would not put too much olive oil on your food, or overeat nuts, you won't binge on Larabars or anything else you know will have unwanted consequences.

Her poop does not stink with the bad smell it had with her previous puppy food product although it does have a quite distinct smell since being on Orijen. She has also been passing gas with the same distinct smell but I do not mind this at all. I am guessing that it probably is because of protein by-products. I am very pleased with this product.

I made a green salad for lunch and brought these out for a side.<br /><br />Regarding nutrition, there are healthier chips out there with more fiber, less salt, less sodium and less fat. However, these are better than potato chips. They are baked, not fried. These have no cholesterol which is positive.  Sodium is 11% of daily value, fiber is 1%, total fat is 8%.  And you can have 10 chips for 130 calories.  10 chips are filling as these are thick, so that's positive. 5 chips are plenty if you want a bit of crunch.  They remind me a tad of thick chinese fortune cookies but aren't sweet, are thick and salty instead.<br /><br />These chips come in other flavors, one of which is multigrain which may have more fiber and be healthier. Other flavors include: cinnamon sugar, parmesan garlic & herb, Italian harvest, and garden veggie medley. I'd like to try the other flavors, but love these simply naked flavor so much, it's hard to imagine liking one better.<br /><br />For a fairly non-guilty chip, these are worth trying.

Safety first; I've learned to trade dogma for pragma at that point. The gum is not made by Jolt itself, it's a licensing gimmick. But, the gum is darn good, too! Good quality gum base and flavor. I do prefer the spearmint. Easier and (in the long run) cheaper than carrying Starbucks jars/cans in your car. You can control the dosing easily.<br /><br />For me (I'm fairly sensitive to caffeine), one will work quickly to wake me up (having something in your mouth helps in its own right). I'm talking almost immediately, somehow. Faster than coffee, in my opinion. However, it doesn't last long. More will last longer--or just space them out. My experience is after about 15 minutes on just 1, it's back to normal. That's probably due to the low dose of 1 gum, and the fact that I suspect the caffeine is in the candy shell, not the actual gum base, so it's dumped into you all at once, and metabolizes all at once too. If there is any downside, that's it. A cup of coffee, you can take your time and drink, so it's more, and rolls off slower (but comes on slower, too).<br /><br />Then again, there's less fiddling with these foil-wrapped pieces of gum, and I prefer that. The package is designed so you can easily pull out the foil pack from the cardboard sleeve, and pop one out. Keeps everything clean and fresh, but still safely accessible. I chewed one in fact today on the way home from work with only 3 hours' sleep the night before (and I should be sleeping instead of writing this review).<br /><br />I bought my first packs at Fry's Electronics. They had the very retail boxes Amazon sells sitting on their checkout counters. So what Amazon is selling is a retail box package--two of them. 24 packs of however many are in a foil pack, and it's a fair amount. If you were to buy the same amount of packages retail at Fry's, it would cost about 50% more than what you pay here at Amazon. But that's a LOT of caffeine gum. So, if you can't find single packs where you are, choose that flavor carefully! I think you can't go wrong with the spearmint flavor--no surprises with the quality or flavor (except pleasant ones). Even knowing I like it, I balk at buying this much. Be prepared to give packs out as stocking stuffers and favors! What I can say from experience, though, is that the gum stays fresh for long periods of time, even in a hot car. I use mine extremely slowly, so I know. The cardboard sleeve and foil blister pack keep light an ambient air out. You'd think they'd done that on purpose! Very lightweight and doesn't take up much room, unlike cans of coffee.<br /><br />I however am browsing Amazon for what other solid-form small caffeine dosages I can keep in the car. There are Penguin mints, but they are sugar-free, and you have to mess with the tin, and then they all can fall out. And you have to take 3 instead of 2 Jolt gums, to equal 1 cup of coffee. The upside is you can suck on them and spread the dose out. Jolt ""Mints"" don't seem to be made currently, or few e-merchants have them in stock. I also found ""Foosh"" mints and the amusingly-named ""Stay Alert Military Caffeine Energy Gum"" here on Amazon. I knew a guy in Special Forces, and caffeine wasn't really what they were given to stay awake on long missions, lol. That ""military gum"" must be for some 'other' (unnamed, of course) branch, I'm sure, yes. I'm avoiding the chocolate covered espresso beans for now, as the few I've tried never did anything for me (though they are tasty), and I worry about the chocolate or beans melting or going bad in my car. May work for you. Keep in mind you can get little bottles and cans of Starbucks just about any grocery or quickie mart store--which store well and taste good, if pricey. Those can keep you going till you (or I) make up your mind :) . I can't find ""Water Joe"" on Amazon, which is (or was?) caffeinated spring water. They sell ""Avitae"" water, but that has just 45mg per container--very low, plus will make you need to pee for how much you'd need. You can also easily purchase caffeine capsules from supplement e-tailers, for instance vitacost. That is probably the cheapest route overall, but will take longer to take effect. You'll find from reviews that nothing is quicker-acting than cafeeine gum.<br /><br />In the end, I'll probably go with this gum, because it works so quickly and is so immediately easy, and the gum chewing itself can help keep me awake when the caffeine fades, but I'm still searching for something even better. Drive safely, whatever you do (advice to myself as much as anyone else)."

Keay,0,0,5,1333411200,What a wonderful invention!,"One of my cat sitters told me about these wonderful products so I bought them locally so I could start using them right away.  On another site there were some good suggestions for using them:  1)  Before giving your pet one of these with the pill in it, give your cat one of the pockets just plain.  Your pet will be so anxious to get another one, he'll gobble the second one with a pill in it without hesitation.  2)  I think this is a key to success.  As you get ready to put a pill in the pocket, be careful to handle the pill with one hand, carefully putting it in the pocket, then with your other hand close up the pocket and hand the treat to your cat - this way the smell of the pill will not be transferred to the outside of the treat.  After a couple of days of success, I guess I got sloppy and didn't cover the pill up well enough.  The pill ended up on the floor, but I scooped it up and put it in another pill pocket and gave it to my cat and she gobbled it up.  I am sooooo happy not to have to stress my cat out any more.<br /><br />Followup:  A few days later I fell asleep in front of TV.  When I woke up the package of pill pockets was on the floor torn to shreds (this cat is declawed by the way).  She had probably eaten 25 pill pockets.  After that I could not get her to eat one - with or without a pill in it.  Soooooo, put them out of reach until you need to use them."

You get light, crusty pastry and impressive chocolate flavor. So if you're worried about whether or not toaster pastries that are billed as organic and healthy can measure up favorably to the market leader, I suggest you try them - I think you'll be pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />It would definitely be a stretch to call these toaster pastries health food, despite the organic, low sodium, zero trans fat and vegetarian claims. But the saturated fat percentage is only 15% of the USRDA 2,000 calorie reference diet, which is relatively low for a toaster pastry. The percent of total calories that come from fat is also relatively low. But you can do that much diet damage with just one or two of some kinds of cookies, and the portion size of these pastries - the nutrition information provided assumes that you're eating an entire pastry - is far more satisfying than a cookie or two. Many people might find just half a pastry to be satisfying. So if you're looking for something sweet to eat, I'd call this a good choice.<br /><br />Kosher certification is provided by COR (Kashrus Council of Canada, based in Toronto, Ontario), and the product is dairy."

It *was* a 5-star food.  But last summer we opened a fresh bag of kibble (same exact packaging bought from our usual store) and immediately noticed it was much lighter in color than previous bags, but we fed it anyway. Within a day our Aussie, who has a bulletproof stomach with absolutely no digestive issues, began to have horrible gas, softer stools, and really loud, liquidy gurgling noises in his abdomen.  We continued to feed the entire bag, thinking that he'd adjust to it eventually because our other dog was fine.  Well, our Aussie never did adjust to it; he spent a month having those symptoms, and we dreaded mealtimes because of the stench and sounds he'd create.<br /><br />The kibble in the next bag we bought was the old normal shade of brown, and our Aussie's stomach noises, soft stools, and awful gas went away practically overnight. But by then I was hearing and reading that Canidae had developed a new formula that was making dogs sick. The stories about people whose dogs got *far* sicker than ours, and the dodgy responses that those long-time customers got from Canidae when they called to complain about the unannounced change, made us decide it was time for a new dog food.  We went with Healthwise, a premium kibble made by the same company that makes Innova, California Natural, and Evo.  It's not worth it to continue to be loyal to Canidae and to risk our dogs perhaps getting as sick as many others have.  Read Canidae's new formula horror stories at consumeraffairs.com."

Donofrio,49,53,1,1318550400,DISAPPOINTED ***UPDATED***,"***UPDATE #2***<br />It seems that Amoretti has made a new flavor: Amoretti Premium Pumpkin PIE Syrup<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0099AUJBW"">Amoretti Premium Pumpkin Pie Syrup (750mL)</a><br />I haven't tried it but the reviews look promising. Read closely regarding sugar content if the taste is not initially to your liking.<br /><br />***UPDATE #1****<br />I still think that this syrup does not have any pumpkin flavor and it tastes exactly like cinnamon red hot candies but the customer service I received was the best I have experienced.  Within an hour of posting my review, I received a call from one of the owners of the company.  He apologized for my disappointment and offered to replace my product with another.  When I finally spoke to him several days later, I had received some other syrups that I must say, exceeded my expectations.<br />I was never into vanilla, caramel or hazelnut flavors before but I didn't realize why.  Comparing these flavors to the others I have tried in the past (namely, Torani) the Amoretti syrups tasted ""real"" and not like a chemical.  What is unique about their flavors is they are not overly sweet but they are full of flavor. I know I am not writing a review for the other flavors so I still hold my opinion that the pumpkin spice has no pumpkin flavor (I suggested to Paul on the phone that he consider changing the name to SPICE and leave out PUMPKIN entirely) however I must say that I was pleasantly surprised at how good the other flavors are.  So much so, that I brought my opened bottles of Torani to work to leave in the breakroom.<br />I am still hoping that Amoretti makes a pumpkin pie sauce syrup and if so, I will be first in line to buy it.<br />As for my other comments about the packaging, the new products I received were sealed with a plastic sleeve around the caps and the cap seals worked better too.  I still prefer a foil seal over the mouth of the bottle but seeing a change in the packaging so quickly based on customer comments was impressive.<br />As for the Amoretti flavors I would strongly suggest....Amoretti Premium Crema di Caramel Syrup, Amoretti Premium Crema di Vanilla Syrup and Amoretti Premium Hazelnut Syrup. I have never had creme syrups before and these are delicious.  I used the caramel and vanilla creme syrups over pumpkin and apple pies so they double as a dessert sauce too.  I have never been into flavored coffees before (with the exception of trying to recreate Starbuck's Pumpkin Spice Latte) and now I find myself having a flavored latte every morning.  My next Amoretti syrups will be the chocolate creme and the orange cream.<br />As I told Paul on the phone, good customer service is lacking in this country and he has set the bar for excellent customer service; he could teach other companies how to treat their customers.  I probably would have thrown away the pumpkin spice syrup and never tried another Amoretti product again, but now I am a loyal customer.<br />Conclusion:  Even though I did not like the Pumpkin Spice syrup, I do not feel like I wasted my money because the company made it right and replaced it with other flavors that I love.<br />Amoretti...please consider making a true pumpkin pie creme sauce (and perhaps a white mocha creme sauce) and I will never buy another brand or need to go to Starbucks again.<br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z86XZY"">Amoretti Premium Crema di Caramel Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z8E0WW"">Amoretti Premium Crema di Vanilla Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004Z7X1F0"">Amoretti Premium Hazelnut Syrup (750mL)</a><br /><br />***ORIGINAL REVIEW***<br />This tastes exactly like the red hot cinnamon candies and I ABHOR those candies.  It doesn't even taste like real cinnamon but just like spicy cinnamon candy.  So I am still searching for Pumpkin Syrup.<br />I find it interesting that one other review mentioned the open cap.  Mine arrived the same way and I was hesitant about using the product because the cap came right off without breaking the plastic seal around the cap and there was no inner seal on the bottle.  The only reason I did use it was because I heard a slight vacuum sound when it opened.  Perhaps it was a false sense of security that could be due to changes in shipping elevations because typically, syrup bottles are not vacuum sealed but the company should consider an inner foil bottle seal and not rely on the cap."

No way could I afford to give these to her often, especially not 2 at a time, even with subscribe and save they are almost two dollars a pouch.  Yikes!  But the other reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because with all the good stuff these have, ORGANIC veggies, gluten free, no sugar, no additives, BPA free packaging, the packaging is a real environmental waste.  It would be a 5 star product if the packaging was recyclable.  They could at least use less plastic on the cap (the cap does make the package resealable, though, which is nice if you have a baby that actually doesn't eat the entire container, can't say I know what that is like!)

It is made with natural ingredients, about as healthy as you can get while still eating beef. It is also low in calories. An entire 4-ounce bag is only 200 calories, or 50 calories per serving, high in protein and low in fat.

An average piece is bite-size, about one inch square and about 1/8 inch thick. Keep in mind that Wild Ride is definitely NOT shoe-leather-tough like most jerky products, thus traditional beef jerky lovers may be put off by the tender quality of the meat. If you're looking for tough meat with the consistency of a radial tire, then buy something else. But if you want beef jerky that is chewy, tender, and flavorful, get this product.<br /><br />I have only one complaint; about 1 in 5 bags have a few pieces containing gristle or sinew (the pieces don't break down completely when you chew them). While this is an inconvenience, the problem is still minor enough for me to give the product five stars based on overall taste and quality.<br /><br />Jumpin' Hot & Spicy is zesty but not so spicy as to be unpleasantly hot.

I buy only grain free Orijen and another dry cat food intended for indoor cats. Our cats enjoy the variety and it does seem to work. The Science Diet has an almost greasy coating on the surface but this seems to draw our cats to it. The size and shape forces them to chew it and this is good for their teeth. We have one cat that loves to swallow his cat food without chewing. How he does it when it's dry, I don't know! I believe that the larger size alone means healthier teeth and gums for our cats. Two of our cats (9 yrs old) are of a breed that is known to suffer from gum diease. They have healthy gums. I believe that a dental diet cat food helps to prevent gum disease....and the larger size provides variety to their diet that they enjoy. Not everything a cat eats has to be 100% certified good for them. Can you imagine if we always ate only healthy food! Boring! If you provide a good quality dry cat food, plenty of water (we use a fountain), routine exercise (play with them!) and a canned cat food as a treat now and then....you will have healthy and happy cats."

However there are times when the real thing just doesn't work, and at those times Via gets just enough things right to make it worthwhile.<br /><br />I'll start out with the negatives. Both varieties remind of drinking from a pot of 'yesterdays' coffee. The kind where you can't finish the pot of coffee and rather than toss it all out, you let it sit and cool overnight and then reheat it the next morning. The next day the coffee is always more bitter and the flavor is flat as compared to a fresh brewed cup. Adding milk or cream helps, but the underlying flavor is still a bit off-putting.<br /><br />Though the worst part about the Via brand is the after-taste. There's something off about it. I don't know quite how to describe it. Almost like a tinge of paper/cardboard taste to it which is a bummer. I find I drink a cup of Via faster than a normal cup of coffee in order to combat that after-taste.<br /><br />Having said all that, I think I'm still likely to continue buying the Via brand. I understand this is instant coffee. I mean I'm tearing open a little pouch (love the design), dropping in some hot water, and I've got coffee. Just like that. That's pretty great. That ease of use, and fairly reasonable pricing means that in circumstances in which convenience trumps quality I can find a place for Via. Camping, too lazy to drive to a coffee shop, otherwise stuck drinking Folgers, quick pick-me-up during a zombie invasion, etc... are a few examples of when a packet of Via could come in handy."

To this mix, I added a variety of sources of protein. The idea was to get all ingredients the body might need, but an absolute bottom in calories. I eat all I want on this regimen and so far I've lost 9 pounds in 18 days.<br /><br />One of the items I picked up was a can of Dynasty Whole Baby Sweet Corn. I found it in the Asian foods section. I've had the baby corn mixed into a variety of Asian dishes, of course, but here I ate the mini-ears as finger foods to accompany my other items. They worked well. They were fresh and tasty and provided good bulk. They're rather bland tasting, but that didn't bother me at all. Will I come back for more? Sure, it's a good product and suits my needs well.<br /><br />Gary Peterson"

Day 3 there were grass shoots just to the top of the jar...and on a whim i popped the jar outside for a day while i was at work - there is nowhere in my house i could have left this inside in the sun without my cat finding it (and she was already curious). When I came home, the jar height sprouts had flourished about 4-5 inches above the jar! Simply, easy and the cat is munching on this happily in front of her favorite sunning spot.

I think that children would like these and they would certainly be a healthy alternative to other chips.  They are also gluten free...which seems to be a growing trend in foods today.  Overall, I would definitively buy these chips again and look forward to trying other flavors of Popchips."

Martin,12,13,5,1332460800,To offset the 1 star reviews,"I was looking to see if this pet food was cheaper on Amazon than it is at my local pet store (it is) and I saw the 1-star reviews and was shocked. I understand that people are having issues with the listing versus what they get in the mail but that has nothing to do with the product itself, which is what you should be reviewing here, maybe with a disclaimer in the review of the food about the mix-up. Amazon is where I go for reviews of products and notes on shipping mix-ups hardly ever tell me what I need to know!<br /><br />That being said, I love Merrick Before Grain. When I adopted my little strays they were living in the zoo and surviving off of raw ground meat and fish, so when I brought them home I chose a grain grain free food because I thought it would be the easiest transition on their stomachs from what they were eating. I've also done some pet nutrition research of my own, and while I'll concede that cats can process nutrients from grains in their foods, it just doesn't seem right to me that they many pet foods have most of the protein coming from vegetable sources, so I stayed grain-free even after the initial adoption.<br /><br />Recently, though, my budget has gotten tighter and I'm close to a ramen budget and decided my cats would have to be put on a ramen diet, too. I did the gradual transition to a new food the way you're supposed to, a little at a time, and the cats didn't seem to mind the change at all. As soon as the cheaper food took over, though, one of my cats started having terrible gas and had some minor tummy troubles. That bag is just about through so I'm going to start the transition back to this food.<br /><br />A big bag of this food ended up cost less per-pound than smaller bags of lower-quality foods, anyway, so I decided the additional cost was worth it. There are also several more expensive brands (Wellness, Blue Buffalo) that have grain in their cat food formulas, unless you opt for their grain-free variety which is even more. Merrick offers the grain-free choice without being the most expensive option out there, and is even comparable in price to many brands that have lower-quality ingredients.<br /><br />All-in-all, definitely worth a try! The canned foods are great, too, but my cats have decided they only like wet foods that are in gravies and won't eat the pates Merrick has."

I already have a bad enough memory, which has gotten worse (and I'm only 36!!) so I obviously got spooked. Then I read that Stevis is the best 'natural' no calorie sweetner out there (I wonder how long it will take for some article to come out and tell you how bad it is for you?) Anyhow, I bought PureVia, and it had an awful after taste, it was truly as if this was some chemicaly fabricated substitute rather than 'natural' I though: "" OK, maybe is the brand.""<br /> Then I bought, Truvia, same thing, that after taste again. Finally I bought Sun Cryslals -- which is not quite sugar free, each packet has 2g of sugar-- I figure, ""they know how bad this thing tastes that is why they are mixing it with actual sugar."" It's just as bad.<br /><br />I'm sorry to say, but I rather have the Splenda and Equal anyday rather than this product. I tried to be positive about it and give it a little while to get used to, but I just can't, and I can't help but to think that somewhere along the line some study is going to claim that it will make you bald, so I rather not sacrifice.

The flavor is mild and just plain good.

Naturally, they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />As an Oregonian, I'm proud to share these delectable snacks with friends, especially those living outside our state and who haven't experienced gourmet chips. I tell them Kettle Brand does for potato chips what microbrews did for beer.<br /><br />Kettle Brand potato chips are unmistakable--a light gold color, rich flavor and amazing crunch. Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />I also recommend these other Kettle Chips flavors: <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6MBUA"">Kettle Chips Sea Salt & Vinegar</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000G6Q4GM"">Kettle Chips Spicy Thai</a>.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal recently noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with these chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them. Classically, a German-style Riesling fits these parameters perfectly."""

This tea isn't even on the scale, as it appears the quality is below what people in China would buy for the cheapest price at a local supermarket. To begin with, the tea is chopped or broken up into something resembling large flakes of fish food. (Note: it does not resemble the picture of the tea leaves shown on the product page at all.) Second, because of this condition, the tea has an overall powdery and dry character to it. Now, maybe you will say, ""But what about the taste? Maybe it tastes just the same..."" No, it doesn't. It is basically tasteless and bland, the opposite of high quality green tea in this style. The best quality green tea leaves in this style are small and bright green. When steeped, they give a fresh and vegetal flavor with all sorts of subtlety and deliciousness. This tea has none of those qualities. In summary: this tea is not good, and especially for the price. Please do yourself a favor and avoid it. In China, I doubt even poor people would drink this tea, which makes me sad to say since I bought it. :-(<br /><br />Foojoy's Longjing in teabags is infinitely superior to this tea, and is a real Longjing.<br /><br /><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0007V1Q7I"">Foojoy Lungching (Dragonwell) Green Tea - 100 Individually Wrapped Tea Bags</a>"

Fitz's root beer is yummy, and their other products, strawberry pop, cream soda, grape pop, and orange pop are delicious as well.

It's really amazing the quality that went into the piece for this price, my bowl is just as perfectly crafted as the one in the picture. If you zoom in on the picture you can really see the quality of the glaze, it's especially evident in the blue-cream accent mark but also the perfectly smooth piece as a whole.

Then I took 1 seedling out and planted it in my garden - it's now 3' high but no peppers, just buds. The other two seedlings got to the point where watering them every 5 hours in the can wasn't enough. I put them in a garden box instead, and tossed the can. Seriously, toss the can from the start or just buy the seeds. The can MIGHT be able to support 1 plant - then, of course, you won't get peppers (or at least not good ones) without cross pollination. I have already had 1 marble-sized red pepper and I have 2 more quarter-diameter peppers on the plant yet to turn red from the 2 in the garden box. The marble-sized one was a mild ghost, compared to ones I've had in the past, but still much hotter than a habanero! If the peppers aren't germinating, make sure to keep the lid on the can and keep the can in a warm to hot area with lots of sun (75+ in the can) for at least two months before giving up.

Mixed all those together, added my chicken and millet, bopped it in the microwave, and wow, I thought I was transported to a good Thai restaurant in spite of the non-traditional millet in it. The red curry paste has the elusive ingredients like lemongrass, galangal, shrimp paste with Kaffir lime already mixed together so adding the other parts is simple.

At the time, it was called Patak's Brinjal Aubergine (or Bringal Pickle Aubergine in some markets).<br /><br />When the company transferred across the Atlantic, the new owners chose to abandon this little gem in favor of Patak's other chutney's and mint pastes -- all of them terrific. But for me, it was like losing a best friend. Talk about COMFORT food... I called the new owners at least once a year begging for a return of ambrosia.<br /><br />For me, it was like trying to break a drug addiction, but in this case, there was no methadone in site. It's difficult to describe a flavor in a text review, but let me try...<br /><br />Some of us like our pastes, sauces and relishes *HOT*. (This one is modestly rated as ""medium""). But when recipes add chili or other heat, it is far too easy to drop the ball on the other flavors. Would you like some sweet, spicy & natural flavors dancing amongst the tangy heat? Do want a flavor that makes you close your eyes and praise the designer for giving you a tongue? If this describes you, then this is as close to paradise as it gets. Next, let's talk about VERSATILE. I spread this baby on everything (the word ""spread"" requires artistic license. Some firm eggplant chunks are as big as your little finger!)<br /><br />Do you have to be Indian to eat this relish? Heck no! I'm a mid-west raised, New England Yankee. But this little jar of heaven has become one of my raison's d'etre (Translation: ""reasons for existence""). To be fair, you have to love Indian or Mediterranean spice. It's loaded with chili, fenugreek, coriander, mustard and turmeric -- and especially fresh garlic (definitely not roasted or denatured!). And of course, it has just the right amount of heat. The basic flavor component is a bit like fermented raisins or rum w/raisin, though I doubt that there is any alcohol.<br /><br />Verdict: 6 out of 5 stars. (That's not a mistake.

The Ridgebacks can burn through other brands of similar type chews within a few bites, so I expected the same thing here. They actually took about 10 minutes to finish one of these Zoe bones and not one dog walked away to see if the other dogs had something better.

Her symptoms were similar to acid reflux in people.I took her to 3 different vets for these issues separately (never realizing they could all be connected). She was on nausea medications, antibiotics for her ears, and several different ear washes. Nothing completely cured any of her issues. After doing a lot of research, i came across Wellness white fish and sweet potato and couldn't be happier. Over a 10 day period, i slowly changed over her food from the Iams i had been feeding her. It has now been about 3 months and she is a completely different dog. Since fully switching over to this food, she hasn't thrown up once and she is no longer scratching at her ears. She has more energy and always wants to play. I no longer have to coax her into eating by mixing in wet food with the Iams. She wags her tail when she sees me filling her bowl now and eats right away. She even licks the bowl when she is done and looks at me for more.

The tea has an excellent aroma which is delightfully aromatic without being too strong, or artificial. The taste of the tea itself is also excellent, with good body, smoothness, and just the right amount of flavorings to make it unique. It's so good that it is sometimes difficult to stop at one cup, but since there is likely less caffeine than in a cup of coffee, its not a problem. Twinings has done a great job of mixing the favors just right to make this a standout tea. And, in spite of this, the price is not unreasonable for a 25 bag package, and since the bags are individually wrapped in airtight seals, they will keep for some time and you won't have to feel pressured to go through the box of 25 quickly just because you opened the package!<br /><br />Offhand, the only tea of this kind I can think of that I might prefer even more is the French <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000LKVROW"">ST. DALFOUR Organic Tea, Tea Bags, Black Cherry, 1.75-Ounce Bags, 25-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>, which is fully organic and with no artificial flavors, a truly unique tea that is not as well known as it should be. The issue here, however, is that this tea can, at times, be very expensive to purchase: you have to watch the changing prices on Amazon to grab them when they are reasonably priced. The St Dalfour is flavored only with black cherry, but the result is similar to the Twinings tea here, but perhaps with even a richer and smoother result, at least, to my taste. (The St Dalfour teas are also individually wrapped in air-tight foil-lined packets, a nice touch.)<br /><br />But this Twinings tea here is simply excellent. Its an easy recommend to the tea lover. Great taste, good packaging, and reasonable price. Five stars.<br /><br />Note:<br />An important tip to make a good cup of tea: use the correct brewing temperature, and don't steep the tea too long. Most black teas can take fully boiled water, but lighter teas can brew better at slightly less than boiling water for the best results. Perhaps even more important (in the case of black teas): don't steep the tea too long! 1 minute to 90 seconds is usually great for a smooth, tasty cup, but if you let a tea bag sit for many minutes in the water, you'll likely come out with an overly strong, muddy taste. Try to keep it to 60 seconds with a few dunks at the end, and then see if your tea comes out more smooth. (If it's not strong enough for you at that point, try 90 seconds.)"

It is also said that the seeds can last 4 or 5 years, even unrefrigerated.<br /><br />The seeds can be eaten raw. They can be placed in water or fruit juices, left for 15 minutes until they become gelatinous and then drunk; the seeds, however, are not dissolved in the liquid.

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not. This is called taking magnesium to bowel tolerance (just like using vitamin C to bowel tolerance.<br /><br />Almonds are a good source of Fiber.<br />One ounce contains approximately 12% of the RDA for an adult.<br />So, in summary, Almonds are a very healthy snack, so what's left to say?<br /><br />Two things:<br />1st be cautious about ""bowel tolerance"" or ""happy bowels"" if you prefer.<br />2nd Taste.

The Organix organic dog food was a hit.  When they see the cans they stand up and take notice.<br /><br />When I opened the can, I could clearly see the difference in quality, and I could certainly smell the difference.  A can of Organix organic dog food is 95% organic, and made is the USA!<br /><br />A typical can contains 7.5% crude protein, 6% crude fat, 1% crude fiber, and 78% moisture.  The feeding recommendations are 3/4 to 1 1/4 per 15 lbs. body weight per day.  The dog food also contains several vitamins (Vitamin E, A, B12, & D3)and minerals.<br /><br />Several of the varities contain organic garlic and thiamine mononitrate which is a synthetic form of vitamin B1.<br /><br />I am so very pleased with this find.  After 4 years, and many bad purchases I've finally found the right food for Darby and Hampshire.  What an awesome dog food.  It really smells and looks like human grade food.<br /><br />I also purchased the Organix dry dog food but Hampshire and Darby both had a week of uncontrollable diareau, and Darby was also vomiting.  I returned the Organix dry food to the store, and they gave me a full refund.<br /><br />The Organix dry dog food made their feces very dark and running and the stains were more difficult than normal to remove.

Kettle Brand chips are also a healthier snacking option than the major chip brands. Kettle Brand chips don't have trans fats, MSG or artificial flavors and colorings. The company also has a line of organic potato chips and all of their products are certified Kosher.<br /><br />Annette Solomon, a reporter for the Salem Statesman Journal noted that a glass of wine goes nicely with Spicy Thai chips. Solomon wrote, ""...you could be missing out on a wonderful pairing. These chips are spicy, so you would want to select a semi-sweet white wine. Also, a moderate amount of acid will subdue the strong flavors of ginger, lime, garlic and cilantro without over-powering them.

Other brands I've tried use too much mustard flavor, which overpowers the Honey Dijon pairing. The Honey Dijon chips make a great side dish on a BBQ plate with baked beans, coleslaw or potato salad and grilled meat. Naturally, they also go down great with beer.<br /><br />The Sea Salt & Vinegar chips are a perfect complement to vegetable trays of cucumber, carrot, celery and cherry tomatoes. Skip the dip; balance the tangy chips by alternating bites of raw vegetable.<br /><br />In summary, I highly recommend Kettle Brand chips, a great buy on Amazon.com."

I was a little bit worried as I remembered that some of the wasabi peas were very hot. In case you're not familiar with wasabi, it is the green paste that is typically served with sushi and diluted down with soy sauce. It is also known as Japanese horseradish, and is quite hot. Fortunately, Blue Diamond has tempered the wasabi with  the savory taste of  soy sauce and it's not as hot as it is in Japanese snack food. But make no mistake, it still has a nice kick, but it doesn't have a long lasting effect. The initial punch of heat fades out quickly to make way for the salty, slightly smoky flavor of soy sauce, making it a very enjoyable snack.<br /><br />5 star snack!"

I'm not a fan of orange soda so that's probably the only reason I don't love this.<br /><br />Lemon-Lime - Again, very sweet. It has a good sprite-type flavor though so I went ahead and tried the diet version as well to see if that would be a staple in our house.<br /><br />Diet Lemon-Lime - It's not an all time favorite but it's good. I have a bottle of this usually for whenever I'm craving something different or something a bit more refreshing and I'm tired of plain water.<br /><br />Cream Soda - WAY too strong. I love cream soda and so I didn't expect any issues with it but just the smell when opening the bottle was enough to make me slightly sick to my stomach. And I'm not exaggerating. I actually threw out the entire bottle after one sip. It has an almost alcoholish undertone to it that doesn't help at all. Gross.<br /><br />Root Beer - Not even close to as bad as the cream soda but slightly reminiscent. I did drink the entire sample that came with the Sodastream but do not plan to buy a bottle of it even though I am a huge fan of root beer.<br /><br />Cola - I bought this to act as an emergency back up for when my husband wanted a rum and coke and didn't have any coke in the house. It tastes a bit like off-brand diet cola to me, probably because of the Splenda. This is very off-putting only because there is so many calories in this and you don't even get a calorie-laden taste. Hahaha. This will continue to be held for those emergencies but we won't be drinking it by itself at all.<br /><br />Grape - This one actually surprised me because I was so prepared not to like it. It's a bit on the sweet side but still much better than many others. I've been putting about 1/4th the amount of syrup in less than called for and it helps cut the sweetness a bit but after that it starts to make the flavor taste watered down. I wish I could find a diet version of this. Not sure if it exists or not but I can't find it on Amazon if it does.<br /><br />I'll update this as I try more.

My cat has had diarrhea/soft stool, blood in stool, and elimination behavior issues for all 8 years that have made me think she is in serious discomfort -- kitty colitis or the like. The stink this cat used to create was also the foulest odor ever to waft past my nostrils. Vets have largely dismissed my concerns about this (small animal vets have earned about as much of my respect as dentists or auto mechanics -- good luck finding a decent one among the lazy, greedy, or just plain incompetent). I've fed Royal Canin products at vet recommendation (cat hated it and no digestive benefit), as well as Taste of the Wild and Chicken Soup for the Cat Lover's Soul on friends' recommendations, all with zero improvement. Then I moved cross country and could not find these brands at the local store. Picked up the pricey Blue Buffalo wildernes food on a whim and voila -- cat is producing truly solid waste, seems to be able to use the litterbox without discomfort, and has reduced the poop odor by ~90%. She also simply seems to like the taste. The price is outrageous, but it's worth it to have her comfortable and to have a house that doesn't smell like the putrid waste of the devil himself whenever the cat takes a crap.

But I did add this Copper Moon Hazelnut coffee last week to my regular order of  Eight O'Clock coffee just to try it out.<br /><br />The Copper Moon Hazelnut coffee arrived well sealed in a plastic bag, but was lacking that smell of fresh coffee beans when the bag is first opened, and after they are ground. The coffee beans are a light brown with no sign of any oily sheen on them. They also lack the stronger coffee taste of the regular Eight O'Clock beans that I have ordered.<br /><br />It is a smooth light roast, not a medium roast, with no hint of a chemical or burnt taste, compared to some other flavored coffee beans that I've tried, and is a good sipping coffee.  The Hazelnut flavoring is slight, but you are aware that it is there. My wife prefers it to the stronger medium roast taste of the Eight O'Clock coffees I buy, but for me it is a bit too bland.<br /><br />If you wish to have a smooth tasting morning cup of light bodied coffee without any annoying aftertaste, then this might be the coffee for you, but I prefer a stronger coffee taste from my coffee beans."

It is a brilliant blend of black tea and citrus that is simply beguiling. I drink a lot of tea. I am always struck by how refreshing and complex the flavor notes are, especially when I haven't had it in a while. The citrus notes are quite subtle on the tongue, but much more present in the aroma. It serves to highlight the black tea in much the same way that coffee brings out the flavor of chocolate-you don't really taste the coffee, but the chocolate is more pronounced and accessible. Very pleasant and delicious.<br /><br />I wish I had such praise for Starbucks the company. Dealing with Starbucks in ANY capacity other than in one of the ubiquitous coffee-stores is irritating and unpleasant. Starbucks Store, the online retailer of Tazo, is especially egregious. Like ALL Starbucks products, Tazo teas are considerably expensive, almost to the point of price-gouging. To order the large filter-bags in the past was to recieve a resealable, coated bag to keep the tea fresh. Then when the Starbucks ""Store"" was created, they quickly ditched the resealable-bags for a crude cardboard box, with a gaping hole for commercial use that can not be resealed, with the unwrapped tea packed in helter-skelter. Moreover, they shipped the whole package in boxes literally big enough to fit a computer, filled with Earth-friendly styrofoam peanuts. Not only does the majority of their coffee benifit large corporations that rob the growers and harvesters of fair-trade, but their shipping practices are out of the Stone Age and, true to form, expensive. Stryrofoam is non-biodegradable and no cheaper than other, greener products, and those big shipping-containers take up unnecessary space on cargo-planes resulting in lost efficiency and increased use of diesel fuel.<br /><br />Now, as if Starbucks wasn't making enough money off their overpriced-products, they have the audacity to short their 24-count Tazo Black Iced Tea by four filter-bags. Now 20 bags for the old price of 24 bags. Nice work if you can get it, I guess. They know that people love their products and will pay for the convenience with which they are offered. But their arrogance is systemic in many of their policies, and certainly no more apparent than dealings with customer service. God help you if you have a problem with shipping or product. I was treated with rudeness and indifference both verbally and with the resolution of my issue. It's like I said, it is a good thing this tea is so good."

I have researched and studied dog foods for several years now and although I believe Canidae is one of better foods out there, Gilligan began having seizures just weeks after he begun eating it and we now home cook his meals.  Gilligan has not had seizures in his lifetime, so we were baffled when all of a sudden he developed a pattern of having a seizure about 3-4 hours after his meal.  His vet said that the pattern made sense to her, because ammonium levels are highest in the blood about 3-4 hours after eating and if the liver doesn't process the protein efficiently, it can definitely cause seizures in the brain.  The day I stopped feeding him the canned food was the last day he had a seizure, and that was about two months ago.  His vet nor I cannot figure out the connection, but my only guess is that it might have something to do with the quality of the meat they use (better than most other brands but still not what humans might consider consumable.)  I must also mention that during this timeframe, Gilligan developed a sinus infection that ultimately we had to have cultured to figure out what it was, and it turns out it was e-coli and the staphococcus bacteria that was up his nose.  Gilligan doesn't have any eyes so when he eats he gets food all over the place (including up his nose), and he was on antibiotics to clear up the infection.  The antibiotics didn't have any effect at all until we stopped feeding him the food (he was on them for about four weeks while eating the food, and about six weeks on his homemade diet.)  Amazingly, the sinus infection began clearing up exponentially after we stopped the canned diet.  He hasn't had any seizures or sinus issues with his home cooked meals, so we won't be going back to Canidae food in the future.  However, for a dog that doesn't have the amount of health issues that Gil has, I still believe the listed ingredients are acceptable and nutritious.  I am extremely critical and picky about the ingredients that go into our dogs' food and I don't find anything on the Lamb or the Senior formulas that severely throws up a red flag except for maybe psyllium husk, which can be hard on the colon for some dogs with sensitive intestinal issues."

I tasted these chips expecting a basic tortilla chip with a hint of flavor, which is what I am used to tasting. The flavor was stronger than subtle and the chips were utlra-fresh tasting.

Good amount of flavoring. Light, not greasy. Chips were sturdy and didn't crumble in the bag easily. No pile of ""chip-lets"" at the bottom. Would probably be a nice surprise in someone's lunch box or at a movie party or summer get-together.<br /><br />CONS: Probably not great for dipping. If you're an olive lover, you may prefer the flavor to be more potent, as I did. If you're concerned about packaging waste, there's a lot of extra bag here which seems wasteful.<br /><br />I personally felt the olive flavor could have been stronger, so I withheld one star, but that is my personal taste.

I was under the impression that these were 100% freeze dried ""raw"" chicken & turkey treats.  When the pkg. arrived I was disappointed to see that there are a heck of a lot of other ingredients.  Seems a high price to pay for a 4 ounce package of ""treats"" that don't have ingredients much different from top quality foods such as Wellness, Before Grain & others.  (Ingredient list is at the bottom of this review if you are looking for that info.)<br /><br />These ""bites"" are only bite sized for medium to large dogs.  For my cats they are WAY too big.  I had to break them into at least 4 - 6 pcs. in order for the cats to be able to eat them.  Even with my breaking them up, the cats still had to work at them.  Their freeze dried condition creates a very airy & light biscuit that is spongy, not crunchy.  It seemed to stick to the cats teeth making it very difficult for them to eat.<br /><br />The cats will ONLY eat these if they are very very hungry.  If I put down anything else, they will ignore the Boost Bites.  I also have barn cats that hunt pretty much everything so I feed them a cheap cat food.  I know they are getting tons of healthy nutrition in all the rodents, insects, birds, amphibians & grasses they can get their little paws on.  However they do enjoy their junk kibble.  Seeing how these Raw Boost Bites were an epic fail for the indoor cats, I tried it on the barn cats.

They also have bits of candied ginger floating in them, so along with a good crunch (They're not rock-hard like some others I could name, though.)you get little bits of chewiness making the texture very appealing.<br /><br />Normally I'd go on about how there's no HFCS, the sugar and flour are organic, and a bunch of other things related to relative healthiness, but seriously?

Two thumbs up so far.<br /><br />I brewed a few cups with filtered water and the excellent aroma exploded.  The aroma gets a 10 out of 10 in my book.  The coffee in the mug also has a nice color and texture (brewed strong with filtered water it is medium-bodied).<br /><br />The overall taste of the coffee is also very good.  The vanilla is sort of ""behind"" the coffee, so it doesn't jump out at you but you know it is there.  I've had other vanilla coffees in which the vanilla overpowers everything; the Starbucks vanilla doesn't do that at all.  I like that.  Along with the vanilla, there may be some hints of butter and cinnamon in the cup.  The expert taster might even notice the trace of sasparilla root hiding in there.  As far as acidity goes, the cup is more soft and sweet than sour and acidic (in my opinion).<br /><br />I was also surprised that this cup does not have the typical burnt (after)tastes that some Starbucks coffee has - there is no murky/dirty lingering flavor.  The cup is pleasant from start to finish.<br /><br />All in all, I was nicely surprised by this cup of coffee and do recommend it."

Most importantly, it's able to grind up my cumin seeds very finely (powder). I also put in already somewhat well-ground dried thyme and it could even grind it more finely. It was not difficult or straining to use. Perhaps 20 turns and I had a teaspoon of thyme, which doesn't seem like much trouble at all when it is so easy to turn. I definitely recommend for spices."

It is old fashioned drink from Michigan, since 1866, and the labeling was known for its lovely green and gold colors and the gnome character. If you look at the can it is actually called ginger soda instead of ale and is different than typical ginger ale in taste. Vernors has a strong vanilla presence, is smoother and more moist, and sweeter than a ginger ale. It is closer to a cream soda than ginger ale, very good. A ginger ale is more dry, higher in carbonation, and has a spicier bite to it. Vernors has 39 grams sugar per can, versus 33 grams per can for Schweppes Ginger Ale. Neither has caffeine.<br /><br />The recipe has changed a bit over the years mostly in the choice of sweeteners. They use the same high fructose corn syrup that the cost-cutting mega soda companies use, rather than the cane sugar they used to use. The down side to that is that the corn syrup syrup drowns out some of the flavors. Many microbrews are using cane sugar again, although it costs more, to get a better taste. Vernor's is still aged in oak barrels for 3 years, no doubt accounting for the smoothness. All in all a great soda for anytime.  The soda is also known, like other ginger drinks, for its use as a home remedy for an upset stomach.<br />Vernor's is a regional soda, and there are many areas of the country you can't find it in. That is why it sells here. They may be selling it in glass bottles again soon, at least there is a page that says so the day I am writing this comment. Search at Amazon for ASIN: B001JK2SEG to see what I mean. Vernors has quite a history, and there are two books at Amazon about the soda. The first is Vernor's Ginger Ale (Images of America: Michigan) ISBN-10: 0738551856. The second book is ""The Vernor's Story: From Gnomes to Now"" ISBN-10: 0472066978 a book about the company's marketing green and gold packaging with the famous gnome, and Vernor's fans."

It's all filler, non-digestible...filler in, filler out. Through this surfing and sifting of information, what was good, explanation of terms, and eager for any information I could get and then pursue, I ended with Canidae All Life Stages Dry. There were others under consideration, but considering cost, balanced with good nutrition, supplements included in the food, and availability, I opted for Canidae.<br /><br />Of the top five ingredients, before the fat (in this case chicken fat), three are animal protein meal, Chicken, Turkey and Lamb meals. The other two ingredients are Brown and White rice, good easily digestible grains. My understanding is dog food is weighted and the ingredients listed based on that weight prior to them being reduced in the cooking process. Meaning when your ingredient list - lists chicken first, that is precooked weight. After cooking the water and some of the nutrients and calories are lost in the process and if the same ingredients were measured for listing after cooking, the ingredient list would not come out looking as good. Chicken might not be as high in the list. If a 'chicken meal' is listed, they start with the same grade of chicken, generally speaking, however meal is weighted and listed after it has been cooked down. This is the same for any 'meal' protein. A 'meal' protein is just the protein you end up with after it is cooked down, the water cooked out of it. So a 'meal' protein in the ingredient list is a good grade meat protein, which won't be reduced by the processing of the ingredients together. Five lbs. of chicken, may end up to be 4lbs, however 5lbs of 'chicken meal', stays 5lbs.(this is made up example for clarity, not based on any math or science). The ingredients go on to list additional herring meal, vitamins, probiotics (for good intestinal health), natural preservatives and supplements like amino acids and calcium to name a couple.<br /><br />Beforehand, Riley was less than excited about meal time. He would pick at it almost from the beginning, walk away, come back - a little more eating and allot of drinking. Now, he eats it.<br /><br />A big benefit and another part of the reason for a search, is the reduction in feces. He was going 6 or 7 times a day and no small amount. We are down to two - four times/day so far. Improvement in condition of feces also. Firmer, more normal coloring, less of it. It seems like his body is getting more out of his food.<br /><br />He seems to have an improved activity level. His playfulness is increased, but not hyper by any means. Just healthier? perhaps. Calms right down on command, even around the other dogs.<br /><br />So far so good for this change. I have read that poor results can happen after weeks or months of a change, but so far so good. He doesn't shed, so I'm watching carefully for any new hair loss. I won't wait it if occurs, I will take him off. I certainly would say, conditionally, this is turning out to be a good food for my dog and would suggest it to others looking for a quality food.<br /><br />** It's been about 2 months now on Canidae.  Riley is still looking good.  No sudden hair loss, healthy, energetic, eating as I type...Still happy with this decision, and am still using it."

Robare ""smurfwreck""",0,0,4,1298419200,"Slightly less flavorful than Honey Maid, but probably better for you...","When wracking one's brain over which graham crackers to buy there are a few questions that have to be asked.  How much do they cost, how do they taste, what's in 'em, and does it matter whether or not the packaging is made with 100 percent recycled paperboard and printed with inks derived from renewable resources like soy, flax, and tree nuts.  For the purposes of this review I'm going to compare these Back to Nature Golden Honey Oat Graham Crackers to Nabisco's Honey Maid Graham Crackers.<br /><br />My first impression of the Back to Nature grahams is that they're pretty good.  They have a nice crunch and you can taste the graham, oats and honey distinctively, which was nice.  They come in a 10 ounce box and contain three packets of crackers with each packet containing 7 crackers.  So lets get to the comparison...<br /><br />Cost.  A 10oz. package of the Back to Nature Grahams costs about three dollars and fifty cents (based on the 6-pack Amazon price), while a 14.4 oz box of Nabisco Honey Maid Grahams costs three dollars (checked my local supermarket this morning.)  So the Back to Nature crackers are about 40 percent more expensive for what they offer.<br /><br />Taste.  While I wouldn't call myself a cracker aficionado, I would say that both taste pretty darn good, though the flavor of the Back to Nature crackers are a bit more subtle on the honey and sweetness.  The Honey Maid crackers are more bold, not cloyingly so, but a bit tastier.<br /><br />Ingredients.  This is potentially the sticking point between the two and it all comes down to how you feel about partially hydrogenated oils and high fructose corn syrup.  Honey Maid's got 'em, and Back to Nature doesn't.  They have pretty much the same nutritional facts with Honey Maid coming in 0.5g higher in overall fat, 1g higher in sugar, and 40mg higher in sodium per serving.  Back to Nature has double the dietary fiber and triple the monounsaturated fat (though the Honey Maid website does mention that even though the box states 0g of trans fats, a serving of crackers can contain up to 0.5g of trans fats.)  Both brand use whole grain wheat flour, though Honey Maid uses as much if not more unbleached enriched flour.  So all in all Back to Nature is a tad more healthy.<br /><br />Sustainability.  Alright, Back to Nature wins this battle hands down with packaging made from 100% recycled paperboard and printed with inks derived from renewable resources like soy, flax, and tree nuts.<br /><br />All in al1, Back to Nature Graham Crackers are a more expensive than your standard crackers, but the cost is going toward sustainability and general quality, though honestly the taste is a bit lacking."

I also use this for cupcakes and muffins. One secret is to put your pan or dish on the top rack of your dishwasher. Then spray all over and don't worry about the spray going outside the pan.

They were ok, but again, they didn't taste like much. And if you don't eat them all right away, they get soggy; freezing and toasting didn't help much, they just burned in the toaster. So far, the best recipe I have found for waffles/pancakes comes from the book The Best Gluten Free Family Cookbook by Donna Washburn and Heather Butt. You have to buy several flours (sorghum, almond, brown rice, and soy) and two starches to make the mix, but it's totally worth it. As for Pamela's Baking and Pancake mix, I know everyone else raves about it, and for pancakes the texture is surprisingly like regular wheat pancakes, but taste is blah and the other recipes aren't very good. I used up my case of 6, but won't be repurchasing.<br />UPDATE**I had been unhappy with using this as a baking mix until I tried the recipe for muffins on the side of the bag.

As for its claim to that it hydrated better, I drank it after mowing the lawn and did not feel better than I do with my regular filtered water.

Upon my first taste of Crystal Light's version, I was a little put off by what came across as a chemical taste, but then I realized it was the mint (""natural flavor"" is the only flavoring listed in the ingredients; no artificial flavorings are listed).  I'm not sure I like the mint in this, but it wouldn't be a mojito without it.  The lime flavor is nice and tangy without being too sour.  Some reviewers have remarked that it's too sweet; others say it's not sweet enough, but I think there is a nice balance.  Also, I find the strength to be fine when prepared as directed.  I can imagine that it would taste even more refreshing if mixed with soda water instead of tap water.<br /><br />Note that this drink, as virtually all sugar-free drinks, is sweetened with a combination of aspartame and ace-K (why the manufacturers don't drop the aspartame and switch to sucralose is beyond me).  Also, curiously, sugar is one of the ingredients (though in apparently such a small amount that they can still get away with calling it ""sugar free"").<br /><br />I don't drink, so I've never had a real mojito and can't comment on the authenticity here, but judged on its own, this version is a pretty good drink.

It was a refreshing change from the water and sugar free lemonade I'd been downing this past Summer in order to keep hydrated.

Hill,9,9,1,1274486400,Marzipan Tastes Bland and Contains Sorbitol,"Normally I buy almond paste, not prepared marzipan, but thought that just this once I could save a little time. There is no one to blame but myself for not reading the ingedient list before buying. This is what happens when you rush. By now I should know that when it comes to even old stand-by products, nothing can be taken for granted.<br /><br />The ingredient list begins as expected, sugar, blanched almonds, water but then it veers off into new frontier - sorbitol -- then corn syrup and potassium sorbate finish the list. Potassium sorbate is used as a preservative to extend shelf-life, and perhaps is necessary, but why is sorbitol added to something as straightforward as marzipan? If this wasn't enough, the marzipan does not have a good almond flavor -- it is incredibly bland.<br /><br />Ironically, and a bit off the subject, I just read a book about dental health that discussed how damaging sorbitol is to the teeth and gums even though it is a popular sweetener in sugar-free gums and mints. The dentist who wrote the book stated that the bad bacteria in the mouth actually adapt to sorbitol quickly and begins to feed on it with greater frenzy than pure sugar.<br /><br />Whether the dental issue is of concern, sorbitol is widely known to cause intestinal distress in some people, and people with irritable bowel syndrome limit or completely avoid the product. Bottom line is that sorbitol isn't usually found in marzipan and unless this ingredient is specifically desired by the purchaser, I'd steer clear for that reason alone.<br /><br />I cook and bake in order to avoid additives, so this marzipan is particularly unacceptable for my use.

I bought the whey through Amazon because it was a couple bucks cheaper than the retail price. I hoped to use it as a replacement to bodybuilding whey protein supplements that have a bunch of other ingredients - glucosamine, creatine, sugars, etc. I give big points to Red Mill for being simple and pure, and it's important to note they are selling a base whey protein concentrate, not a protein shake mix. It dissolves relatively well into water but not as well as leading protein drinks. The taste is what's sticking in my craw - it has a very raw, difficult to overcome flavor. It's like swallowing thin wallpaper paste (consistency) that has a strong, flat taste of the milky liquid that forms in cottage cheese containers. If you're planning to mix recipes like other reviewers recommend (adding apple juice, or spinach(?), or bananas and other fruit), you'll be fine.

Now in January 2012<br />the price for the exact same seeds is $14.50 with the same free<br />shipping terms.<br /><br />I read here and there that the US economy is finally on the rebound<br />so perhaps that accounts for the nearly 53% price increase in four<br />months.

The manufacturer recommends that you replace each cup of all purpose wheat flour with 3/4 cup of the Multi-Blend Gluten Free Flour. I was quite skeptical because of earlier disappointments with gluten free products. To try the product I used my favorite corn bread recipe (old fashioned New England style with low fat/low sugar). When the corn bread came out of the oven it looked exactly like the corn bread I would make with wheat flour. The taste and consistency of the gluten free corn bread was equal to or better than the wheat based recipe. It was also as light as the wheat based recipe. On the down side this flour does not work with wheat based recipes for yeast breads. The manufacturer indicates that you should try gluten free recipes for yeast breads. I need to do some more research on gluten free recipes for yeast breads. If I find recipes that I like, I will note them here."

Recently Kettle brand Honey Dijon Mustard took that slot. So when I found out they had sour cream & onion I just had to try them.<br /><br />As soon as I opened the bag the chips smelled of powdered milk. And indeed each chip is coated with a powdered sour cream that is just awful. It tastes like rancid milk. Not just sour, but like sour cream that when rancid. The powdery texture is also extremely unappealing. I basically hated these chips. I would not recommend these chips to anyone unless they had a particular affinity for a powdery, chalky texture on a chip, with a rancid (and onion flavor) and I have a hard time believing that person exists.<br /><br />I plan on contacting Kettle and sharing my thoughts with them. Hopefully they'll reassess the seasoning on these otherwise wonderful kettle style chips."

Great for brewing a cup at a time with an infuser or for larger amounts with my TeaDrop. Loose leaf tea is very economical even for premium brands compared to tea bags. Bulk loose tea is also typically better than the powdered teas used for tea bags. Stash is a leading organic tea brand. You can also make any amount using a method common in India by adding the tea leaves into roiling boil water in a pot on the stove for a 3-7 minutes (to taste) and then using a strainer to remove the tea leaves. Longer boiling makes darker tea, but any tea can also become more bitter if boiled longer or too long this way. It is also not advisable to leave the tea leaves in the tea after boiling for the same reason. Use a timer and boil a test batch. Dip a ladle and pour through a strainer into tasting cups at one minute intervals. Set them aside and taste test after finished. Choose your preferred time and strength for future use.

So be very wary of the fact that dogs seem to go crazy over these treats.  Although the Dogswell Company states clearly that their product is not contaminated, and that third party testers have confirmed this, do the owners of the company truly know what's happening in China behind the scenes?  Or who might get paid off to test certain batches of jerky?  I and my vet have been unable to come up with any other explanation for my dog's anorexia, except that it coincides with her increased interest (and now ONLY interest) in Happy Hips since I began treating her with them last spring.  Thankfully, her kidney function is still fine, but if you research this on the web, many other dogs were not so lucky and died due to kidney failure.<br />See this link to the FDA website suggesting caution to consumers in using chicken jerky products from China.

Sodium Laureth Sulfate is known for being bad for colored hair, so I am not sure why it is in this ""Color Repair"" shampoo.<br /><br />The shampoo itself is thick and creamy and has a slightly pink color. It has a really nice almost floral scent. It lathers well and you don't have to use a ton of it. Honestly, it feels like Pantene Pro-V. It leaves your hair feeling clean, soft and healthy. However, I don't think it does anything to repair your color. The Sodium Laureth Sulfate may even harm it. My hair is not damaged, so I can not attest to that part of the shampoo claim.<br /><br />Overall, I do like the shampoo and will buy it in the future, but only if it is on sale."

""The company gives a portion of profits to non-profits that help childhood cancer survivors in honor of co-founder Chuck Genuardi's niece Lily, who battled childhood brain cancer."".<br /><br />Of course it is wonderful that a portion of profits will help childhood cancer survivors in Lily's honor.

It is so easy and addictive to drink that you can get caffeine overdosed without knowing it until bedtime.  I happens to have a can of Cafe Bustelo for comparison. Although Cafe Bustelo also receives rave reviews, Cafe Du Monde gets my vote for cream coffee.<br /><br />This coffee comes in drip grind. But I would not recommend using drip coffee maker as the brew would be too diluted. If you do not have the time of coffee press, I recommend using Senseo (http://www.amazon.com/Senseo-Single-Serve-Gourmet-Coffee-Machine/dp/B001QTVS5K). It takes me 10 seconds to make a Senseo coffee pod with a regular 4-cup basket coffee filters. The brew from Senseo is stronger than drip coffee maker with crema on top similar to the result from an espresso machine.

If you like strong tea, you're in the wrong place.  This is a subtle white.  I find it delicious, but many of my friends want a stronger flavor.

It's a white tea.  It steeps FAST.  If you'd like more flavor, choose another tea or put in 2-3 teabags.  This tea will not always forgive a long steep and can become very bitter if left too long.<br /><br />3.  It's not a very good iced tea.

Once I started using it I have found it is very helpful in curbing my sweet tooth appetite. It is good for making hot chocolate and of course great in coffee.

Fabbri ""afabbri""",0,0,4,1332374400,Tasty energy drink concentrate w/ Zero calories,"One bottle of this Vitamin Squeeze Energy Drink makes 24, one cup, servings of fairly tasty diet juice drink.  The flavor is similar to something like Vitamin Water Zero, but slightly less ""diet"" or fake sweetener flavor.  This fruit punch concentrate basically consists of natural flavors, sucralose (splenda) caffeine, and vitamins + taurine.  The flavor is better than I expected.  I will drink this daily, no doubt.<br /><br />Each serving gets you 120% daily vitamin C, and 40% daily of B vitamins.  There is 40mg of caffeine (slightly more than a coca cola, slightly less than a mountain dew, or 1/2 the caffeine in a Red Bull).<br /><br />Likes:<br /><br />- Flavor.  Pretty good for a zero calorie drink.  Sweet but not too fake tasting.<br />- Compact.  Saves fridge space.<br />- Nutrition.  Zero sugar.  Vitamins and a splash of caffeine.<br /><br />Dislikes:<br />- Dosing.  One squeeze is supposed to yield 15ml (1/2 fl oz).  I placed my glass on a kitchen scale and found it takes about a medium-long squeeze to yield 15ml.  A short squeeze is 10 ml.  The longest squeeze was more like 22ml.  I say go by flavor.  In 8 oz of water it should be fairly flavorful, but not too strong or watery.<br /><br />Overall I like this product and will use it up.  4+ stars."

With only 410 calories, it still made a satisfying meal with lots of ""chew appeal"". The dominant texture was crunchy: crackers, fruit and nut snack and the little bag of dry roasted soybeans each made a different crunchy noise in the mouth. The banana chips in the fruit snack were quite hard and the soybeans (called edamame on the package) needed lots of chewing. The latter were dry to the core and lightly salted so when chewed they gradually ground to powder in the mouth and provoked thirst. I remembered eating these (in a fresher version) in Japanese bars. The salmon spread is brightly colored, spicy hot and is a great foil for the soybeans which are neutral underneath the light salting. The crackers are delicate and make perfect platforms for the salmon. The dark chocolate is excellent--a very pure flavor, not too sweet.<br /><br />Although salt is not laid in with a deliberately heavy hand, nearly everything here has salt in it. Because one box contains 660mg of sodium, this isn't designed for folks on a low salt diet.

I have another that has the treat out in 5 minutes and has the little treats out in about an hour (he then waits for the other dog to give up, then finishes that off too).  The blue silicone part is the toy they have had the longest and seems to still be lasting.  I have had it over 6 months.  I have the red fire hydrant one also and it is almost torn up and I have had it less time than this.  I think the configuration of the other allows my dog a better angle to chew (and thus destroy)the toy.<br /><br />I know some people who have destructive dogs complain that it does not last but I would venture to say thier dog is so destructive that nothing works.  I would be interested to know if it outlasted most other toys given to them.  I am not saying it will work for sure for your dog, but I do say it is worth a try, as I considered my dogs hopeless (they tore up everyting in 5 minutes or less) before I found this.<br /><br />It has come to my attention that if you moisten the edges the treat pops in easier (great to know because I was using a spoon to wedge it in).  Just make sure you let it dry before giving it to them so it is more difficult for your dog to get out and (love this tip) put the treat in upside down so the dome is facing inwards and the treat will last longer because it is more difficult for your doggie to get at."

The ginger flavor is bracingly fresh and clean, without that annoying ""bite"" -- that cloying aftertaste -- that most other ginger snaps have.<br /><br />And there is a little bit more grit to the texture than with other store-bought ginger snaps.<br /><br />I also like a neat little feature on the packaging -- a peel-and-stick strip of tape you can use to reseal the package after you munch a bunch of cookies, to keep the remaining snaps snappy.<br /><br />Looking at the list of ingredients, I see that most appear to be the product of Mother Nature, not laboratory science.<br /><br />At a little under $3 for a 6-1/2-ounce package, these classy cookies seem to be not too unreasonably priced, a rarity these days.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a superior ginger snap on the cookie shelf of your favorite supermarket, I suggest you give these a try.  I give them thumbs up -- with a snap!"

The Amazing Clubs selection is just as impressive as the olive oil we have picked up in New Zealand and Argentina and we didn't have to fly anywhere to get it.  It has consistently been a wonderful addition to our kitchen each month.  We have not able to find the same selection at the local grocery or specialty store.  We cook with olive oil for almost every meal... anything from salmon to roasted vegetables to homemade salad dressing.  With the new variations that arrive each month, we find yourselves coming up with new ways to continually enjoy these beautiful oils every day or just adding a little variety to some of our staple recipes... you'd be surprised what a difference a new oil can make in a meal.  We are extremely impressed with the quality and diversity of the oils that Amazing Clubs has given us access to.  We highly recommend ordering the Olive Oil Club for yourself or friends!

(I believe that with a dogs sense of smell they KNOW exactly what is in their food; however they have no choice but to eat what we feed them...just Google what is in most commercial dog foods, and you'll see why your dog may not be thrilled to eat it up...if a dog can detect cancer in a person, they can detect all sorts of other things that aren't supposed to be eaten.) Anyway...I used to feed Purina lamb and rice to my dogs, but I was finding my young Porty was having trouble with it, and my 15 yr old would eat a few bits and then leave her dish. So, I started making their food, and came up with a wonderfully nutritious and tasty recipe. The dogs loved my homemade dog food, and my 15 yr old began putting on weight again, but I didn't always have time to make their food. And, homemade dog food is kind of hard on the wallet. So, I started to research all the natural dog foods out there, compare costs etc. I arrived on Harmony Farms, and guess what...my dogs LOVE it just as much as they love my home made dog food. My young Porty no longer has stomach troubles and she looks great; my 15 yr old finishes her meals and looks for more. Both have shiny coats and energy. No one can believe my old girl is 15 years old. I have told my friends about Harmony Farms dog food, and when they've switched over, they've reported similar positive results. My brother-in-law's dog had always been a very fussy eater, and had skin problems with a thinning coat. When they started to feed her Harmony Farms, she became an eager eater, more happy and outgoing, and her skin and coat condition has completely cleared up (...I'm thinking she had an allergy to whatever was in her other food, which I think was Iams). Other friends have commented on how happy their dogs are at meal time now...and they had all been feeding their dogs premium, top of the line dogs foods AND paying top of the line prices. Harmony Farms products are very reasonably priced. Not the cheapest dog food on the shelf, but, in my opinion, you are buying the best quality food on the market, so it's an incredibly GOOD DEAL! It may also mean you make fewer trips to the veterinarian's office. I and my friends are so happy we have found this food for our dogs. :)"

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

Having previously lived in Germany for nearly 30 years, I know that both this brand, as well as sauce mixes made by Maggi, are used in many gaste houses (restaurants) throughout Europe to create those delicious cream sauces found on e.g., pork medallions.  The unique blend of spices helps to create a taste not found in plain mushroom soup.  Of course real cream, rather than water, is usually used which further enhances the flavor of the sauce.  I usually use about half water and half, half and half for the required liquid content.  And, I never use oleo or margarine to sautee' the mushrooms.  Use real butter.  Recommend you serve this sauce over pork along with real German egg noodles (called spaetzle) and German rote-Kohl (red cabbage) for a truly scrumptious traditional German meal.  Both spaetzle and rote-kohl can be found in many of the larger supermarkets European food section.  Try to buy the rote-kohl ""mit appfel"" (with apple).  Or if you can't find it with apple, cut up about a half cup of most any RED apple (I use a Gala apple) and add it in.  Do not use any water as a liquid add in.  Instead, use about a half to one cup of RED wine.  I like to use Lambrusco.  Don't worry, the wine won't made you tipsey.  It simply enhances the flavor of the rote-kohl whereas water doesn't.  If you can't find these items locally, a wonderful web site for all kinds of German and other European specialties is[...]  I buy from them a lot especially around Christmas time when traditional German cookies and candies are available.  Their prices (for both their products and shipping) are a LOT LESS than those charged by the sellers listed here.  And, they have many German receipes IN ENGLISH and/or English translations for mixes requiring add in ingredients such as this sauce mix.  Their shipping is incredible.

We saw them at a local pet supply store, and the store owner showed us an antler that his french bulldog has been chewing for three months. After THREE MONTHS it was just the fat end. So we went ahead and bought two. Now our dog has one in the car and one at home, and she chews on them WHENEVER she has a chance, and there is barely any damage. They don't splinter, and they are MUCH better than Nylabones, because after our dog chews on a Nylabone for 2 hours, its shredded, but with antlers she needs to put some effort in. And they are healthy! I would recommend Antlerz to any dog owner."

After all the shots she just received, she had to go through a lengthy treatment with more medications than I would ever want to give my dog, but I had no choice.  I was determined to get her healthy again, and knew that good nutrition would be especially important during this time of illness and treatment.  Lily received Olewo Carrots and Red Beets with her daily meals, and while the carrots improved her digestive health, I feel it was the Olewo Red Beets which played an important role in her recovery.  The red beets are a great natural detoxifier and helped get rid of the toxins in her system from all the medications. It also helped strengthen her immune system.  At the very beginning of her treatment she was sleeping most of the time, but after adding the red beets to her diet, she had more energy and was more active.  Lily is doing well now and will continue to receive Olewo to make sure she remains in good health."

Actually, I adore GOOD Turkish Delight, but it's not available on every street corner in Boston.  A local specialty food store carries it, but it is coated in third or fourth rate chocolate, and has more in common with a Jello Jiggler than this delicate confectionary.  Like many Americans, I got my only introduction to Turkish Delight while reading the ""Chronicles of Narnia"" as a child, and discovered this sweet treat only as an adult.  My favorite Turkish Delight is perfumed with roses, as is this treat, which tastes incredible when taking a sharp inhale while eating. (do this carefully, whilst no one is watching)<br /><br />In Germany, I get my Turkish Delight fix is run by Turkish people (duh), who make this traditional treat on a daily basis, and it is good enough to believe that Edmund betrayed Aslan and a kingdom for just another taste.  There, the shopkeeper there serves the treat fresh, rolling it in pistachio meats before gift wrapping the box and handing it to me.  This stuff is rather like a dream of that Turkish Delight:  it has some of the character of what I want, and is rather pleasant, but there's no way it's the real deal.  Ironically, this item is made in Turkey and one would expect that it is produced by Turks, which makes it more of a real deal than the Turkish Delight I could use as a reason to fly to Europe.  If you are willing to try this because your memories are pushing you to do so, give it a whirl:  it is a very nice splurge at a very reasonable price,  If you have never tasted Real Turkish Delight and what to know what the Narnians were fussing about, remember that this is merely a pale shadow of what this dessert could be.<br /><br />One note:  this candy comes packed in confectioner's sugar, to keep the jellied cubes from croaking in transit.

In short, the box was just WAY too big = wasteful packaging."

It sinks in well and leaves my skin feeling very soft and smooth.  It doesn't cause breakouts (which is easy to do with my sensitive skin).  My luck with Alba products has mostly been great with one exception.  The Sea renewal cream was way too oily and harsh on my skin.  Other than that, I've never been disappointed.

Both cats I've feed this to have had massive diarrhea. I've switched canned foods on my cats before and never had this reaction.  One of the cats is an outside cat and will literally eat anything, this food not only gives him diarrhea but seems to reduce his appetite for his hard food which he usually munches on throughout the day.  I like Wellness, I consistently buy the hard food and one of my cats really enjoyed their sliced chicken in the 3 oz cans.  The only reason I tried this was because the other cat wouldn't eat the chicken slices and the the 3 oz cans are too expensive to keep wasting on him and I didn't want to have to buy different food for each.  But I guess I'll being going back to the slices and he'll have to get used to the slices as the diarrhea isn't worth it.  Maybe I just received an old batch. Was thinking of donating the remaining cans to a shelter, but as I approach Day 2 of the diarrhea onslaught I'll just trash them (or attempt to get a refund from Amazon if possible), shelter cats don't need anymore stress. From now on I'll be buying individual cans at the pet store first before I jump the gun and buy a whole case online."

I have been feeding my dogs Holistic Select for about a year after switching from Purina  Beneful (which IS one of the unhealthy dog foods referred to in the 2-star review). I have seen noticeable improvement in their coat, skin, muscle mass and energy levels, not to mention more consistent and less waste matter. Those who read the above review, please do your own research before taking this reviewer for their word. Holistic Select is most definitely a premium dog food. I completed quite a bit of research between Holistic Select, Orijen and Lotus brand dog foods, and though Orijen proved to have higher protein content (which is best for most breeds), I decided on Holistic Select Lamb because my Dalmatian requires lower protein due to an inadequate ability to process purines which results in kidney stone formation.<br />So, to those reading, yes the above review is extremely accurate for most retail store brand dog foods, (even when marked ""natural""), but I would not classify Holistic Select in the same category as those.  Do your research. The Dog Food Advisor ([...]) is a great place to start comparing dog food brands. A food description and ingredient breakdown is provided for each brand listed, along with a 1-5 star rating. Holistic Select Dry Dog Food received 4-stars out of 5, classifying it as a premium dog food, while Purina Beneful Dry received 1-star.  Reference the links below:<br />[...]"

We usually drink 2% milk, and I found that when I would use my K cup coffee machine and add 2% cold milk to the freshly made coffee, I would always have to microwave the coffee to get it back to being hot enough to drink.  This slowed down the instant dire need for a great cup of morning Joe, and made the K cup process too slow!  I was looking for a milk product to store for emergency food, when I came across this product.  I bought it, and had to try it out.  I never got around to making ""milk"" with it as it is just so good in coffee!  3 heaping teaspoons in a 12 oz ""black magic"" K cup coffee and stir.  It is so smooth, and rich, and it does not take away any heat, so no need to re-heat in the microwave!  I went through the entire #10 can using it that way, and sharing it with others to let them try it, they too love it, and have ordered it.  It does come in smaller containers.<br /><br />About that ""emergency food"" use, I called Nestle and it only has about a year shelf ""use by"" date stamped on it, and all they would say is ""it is best to use it before the use by date stamp"" and they would not say how long it actually would last, unopened. They did say that when it is made into milk, it should be used within 24 hours which was a surprise to me.  It is made in Mexico, but by Nestle's stated very high standards and they said their quality control is as high as in the states there.<br /><br />I am storing a smaller container on our camping trailer for those times we run out of milk, with no stores nearby, and since I am going through it quickly enough, I will have a couple cans on hand for ""emergency food"" but will have to rotate them within a year.

I also taste a sweet note in the coffee that counteracts the typical bitter notes, potentially allowing me to drink a cup without any adjunct sweeteners or milk.

Hamburgers, chicken nuggets, and of course tex-mex foods like taquitos and quesadillas. It's a creamy somewhat thick sauce, so be prepared if you were expecting a thinner style.

There are 5 bars per box, and each weighs 1.62 ounces but since nuts are heavy, the bar does not appear to be any larger than a normal chewy granola bar. And calling them ""nut bars"" seems a bit confusing when they are the usual granola bar configuration with extra nuts. A better description would be a chewy honey oat granola bar with lots of nuts. The nuts, incorporated within the soft oat/rice crispy bar, do add a satisfying crunch.<br /><br />Why four stars instead of five? As noted above size isn't BIG, it is the usual size of a granola bar. Additionally, since nuts are high in calories and fat (and good things too) the 220 calorie count and 12 grams of fat per bar make these a special treat rather than a daily indulgence. The main difference between a candy bar and this nut bar is the 7 grams of protein and 3 grams of fiber per bar.

There are definitely oats in the bar, but crisped rice is the third ingredient and whole grain oats (in the form of granola) are seventh.

When Starbucks announced Natural Fusions Ground Coffee, I really looked forward to purchasing and tasting it. Vanilla-flavored coffee is one of my personal favorites - as long as it is not sickenly artificial. I love Gevalia's French Vanilla, but prefer not to have to get regular shipments of a product.  I'd much rather be able to purchase my coffee as needed and at the local grocer.  Based on my experience with regular Starbucks ground coffees, I was sure Starbucks would be able to produce an excellent flavored coffee.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel Starbucks missed the mark, just as they did with the Caramel Flavored Natural Fusions. The Vanilla Flavored Natural Infusions Ground Coffee has almost no vanilla odor and has even less vanilla taste. Since the coffee I purchased was just being put onto the grocer's shelf, I know it was fresh and had not lost scent or flavor due to aging. In an attempt to be sure my dissatisfaction was not due to drinking my coffee black with sweetner only, I added cream to the cup. This did nothing to enhance or elevate the intensity of the vanilla flavor. Rather, this coffee is a very good coffee, but does not have any layers of other flavors, either subtle or more noticeable.  For those looking for a flavored coffee which disguises the taste of coffee, this is definitely not for you.<br /><br />I am less than pleased with Starbucks Natural Fusions Vanilla Flavored coffee and have rated it as an average brew. If you are interested in trying this coffee, visit the manufacturer's website and put the word ""fusions"" in the search box. You will be able to print two coupons for $1.50 off a bag of this coffee so that you can decide for yourself whether Starbucks has produced a brew that meets its usual quality standards."

Wouldn't even melt!,"Ghirardelli had been my standby for Xmas candy-making since it was the ONLY brand left I could find in my town that made ACTUAL white chocolate chips, but this year they, like everyone else, seem to think that no one will notice the difference if they take out the actual, y'know, chocolate part. (Believe me, manufacturers, we can tell the difference.)<br /><br />So this year, since I couldn't find any white chocolate chips, I just went with the Nestle's, since if Ghirardelli is making the same inferior product I might as well go with the cheaper option, right? Well, I should have just given up on using white coatings on anything, because this stuff is utter crap.  I actually don't think it tastes all that bad - it tastes like the coating on a Zero bar, basically. But if I'm making homemade candy, it's not supposed to taste like a cheap, commercial candy bar - it's supposed to taste like good quality homemade candy! More important than this though is the fact that they didn't even melt, and I couldn't use them. I followed the directions precisely, but I kept stirring and heating in tiny increments and they just. wouldn't. melt!, and then finally, I guess they seized or something, because I was left with an unusable lump of half-melted, weirdly-hardened white chips.

My crew cut has never been softer or more manageable than it is today.  Rubbing my fingers through short, luxurious hair, I can actually feel each individual hair rubbing its softness on my fingertips.  Very, very soft.  Now, nourishing the scalp?  I'm not entirely sure what that even means.  My scalp didn't feel malnourished prior, and it doesn't feel any different today.  And while I'm on the topic, my bottle says something like ""proven to make your scalp healthier*.""  Notice that asterisk?  Searching for the fine print, it then says something like ""when shampooing first.""  I take that to mean that whatever study they used to provide that statement was using some kind of harsh shampoo, and the conditioner made the hair feeling a bit less like burlap or tweed.  But...my hair is soft, and that's what's important here.<br /><br />The bottle itself is even interesting.  It stands straight up, and opens from the bottom, ensuring that you can squeeze out the very last drop of this conditioner.  The conditioner is pretty thick, so this is actually very nice - if it were to stand upright, it'd be a pain to get the last few squirts out.

I am a 45 year old black woman, suffering from gout, constipation, fibrmyalgia, muscle cramps, brain fog and horrible insomnia, along with chronic depression and yes I am overweight, yes folks I am a hot mess!<br /><br />I found out about CALM from an article about the five vitamins and supplements that our bodies need the most, I was already taking four of them, so that made me feel good and when I read about CALM, I was like great this may be just what I need, especially after I read about all of the possible benefits that were to be achieved after taking CALM.<br /><br />Well, let me tell you how it has helped me in under a week. I am sleeping through the night, my mood is improving and that in of it self is a miracle. I have been suffering from depression for over 20 years and nothing helped, this is helping. I am able to think a bit clearer and turn off my brain, which in turn is also helping me sleep!<br /><br />Another major benefit is relief of muscle pain and cramps, especially after exercising! I did a particularly tough workout the other day, well hell any workout when you're fat can be tough, but this one consisted of weight training, cardio and ab work. I fully expected that I would be in horrible pain the next morning, but I wasn't as a matter of fact, I felt great! This also, seems to be helping with my fibromyalgia too.<br /><br />Now, the biggest benefit so far is the relief from my contipation! If I went once a week, I considered myself lucky. I had tried everything under the sun to get things moving so to speak, and either it would work for a while and then nothing, or worse yet nothing would happen at all. Any one that has suffered from constipation, knows now horrible it can be and how miserable you can become, both emotionally and physically. Well, since I have been taking CALM, I go two sometimes three times a day! I feel so much lighter, my friends and family always said I was full of crap and I guess they were right!<br /><br />I guess after reading my review you are thinking either she is being paid for this or it really works, well it is definitely the latter!

Our Erewhon certified gluten free cereals are made in a peanut-free, tree-nut free and dairy-free facility. They are run on a shared line with gluten and we abide by good manufacturing practices to help ensure against cross-contamination. This consists of the machinery being sanitized and thoroughly washed down before the cereal is made. Then after it is made, the cereal is tested to ensure it is less than 20 ppm of gluten. We sent the cereal to a separate facility last fall to double check the levels at which it tested and found it to be less than 5ppm of gluten. In November of 2010, our Erewhon gluten free cereals were certified gluten free by GIG. I hope this helps clarify our current practices as I realize there are reviews dating back many years on amazon.com and thought it would be helpful to update interested consumers of it on amazon.com."

And as an animal loving pet owner I am very glad that the label of each can makes it clear that no dolphins were harmed when they rounded up all the chickens. I only hope they managed to keep the whales out of the chicken farm as well."

It contains hibiscus, orange peel, lemongrass, rosehips, natural raspberry flavor, licorice powder, and citric acid. The package says it also contains soy, but that makes little sense to me. It is a fine tasting herb tea.<br /><br />If you like a more subtle tea, you may not be crazy about Wild Raspberry. But if you like Celestial Seasonings and other commercial teas, I think that this is a good one. The reason I gave this tea four stars instead of five is that it isn't as pure as it could be (contains additives and flavorings) and I can tell. I prefer a more subtle tea. And I save five stars for the very best teas I've tried. But for those of you who like a lot of flavor, and can't taste the additives, it's just fine!<br /><br />Recommended.<br />****"

Takes some getting used to, having an actual seed in the middle of a candy.  The main complaint I have with these is the aftertaste - the C Howards violet mints may have tasted slightly soapy and perfumey, but they leave you with a wonderful aftertaste that sweetens the breath for a while after.

I don't really care as long as people find out what's real and can avoid my mistakes.<br /><br />I got my wonderful little sweet Bella Bean when she was a few days shy of three years old. She had been bounced around from house to house and eating whatever was cheap. I have had cats around me my entire life, for about twenty-five years now. My mother always just fed them whatever, the kinds of food you buy in the supermarket - Friskies, Nine Lives, Kit & Kaboodle, stuff like that. And our cats were always fine, at least in terms of their eating habits. They would eat in the morning, stop when they were done, come back, and eat some more when they got hungry.<br /><br />My housemate at the time was working for Hill's and assured me that this was the best food ever made, so great, so on and so forth. I now know that she is an utter buffoon, but I initially trusted her judgment, which is so unfortunate because she doesn't think. She also had plenty of coupons for free or deeply discounted bags, which made it a much more attractive choice.<br /><br />I first tried feeding the little Bean an unmeasured amount of Science Diet in a bowl, but that didn't work, as she would devour it in one sitting. So then I took to measuring it, and she did the same thing. Then I started parsing it out to twice a day. That didn't work either, because she would start going crazy in the middle of the day, running around, intentionally destroying things, deliberately spilling her water, crying, etc., until she got more food. So then I split it into three servings. Same thing. Then it got to be four servings. That was a little better, but it was too much maintenance and unrealistic to be around every day to feed her four times. So then it went back to three. All the while, I was trying to reduce the amount of food I was feeding her to less than 3/4 of a cup because she was a little chubby. Reducing was hell. She became even more hungry, but I figured she would get used to it. Not really.<br /><br />For over a year, she would wake me up every morning looking for food in a serious way, knocking things off my desk, ripping up any paper she could find, scratching at the door and committing general acts of mischief. As soon as she got food, she was back to her sweet self, but only for three or four hours.<br /><br />We thought she was bored, we thought she was a little nutty, and maybe even had a kitty eating disorder. She always wanted food. It was kind of funny but in the end it was just sad.<br /><br />A few weeks back, we took her to a new (good, non-money factory) vet for her second checkup since I've had her. I talked with him about her being always hungry. He asked what she ate, and I told him the adult indoor Science Diet. Without saying as much, he basically told me that this food is garbage and I should look for something else. He said cat food should have a protein followed by a carbohydrate as the first two ingredients. Science Diet does, in a very loose, by-product kind of way - ground up slaughterhouse leftovers and corn dust. Then they put a bunch of vitamins in it to make it ""healthy,"" instead of just using good ingredients from the beginning. Not that I care about spending money on the Bean, but this food is way too expensive for what it is.<br /><br />So we began transitioning her onto Wellness indoor formula about two weeks ago. She is still eating 50 percent Science Diet with 50 percent Wellness (you really shouldn't just give a cat different food one day out of the blue) but SHE NEVER FREAKS OUT ANYMORE. It's amazing. And it's 100 percent because she is eating real food now, along with that sawdust and chicken hearts I still regrettable have to feed her. We have her down to eating twice a day, only 1/3 cup in TOTAL. She was eating three times a day, 5/8 of a cup in total. Now she eats some in the morning, walks away, eats some more a few hours later, and then looks for dinner about twelve hours after her initial feeding. No more knocking things over, no more trashing Dad's papers on the desk, no more howling, no more deliberately spilled water on the floor. It's incredible.<br /><br />I feel so bad that I was doing this to her for so long. We really thought she was just being dramatic or whatever. But no, she was genuinely hungry because she wasn't eating any real food.<br /><br />Do your cat a favor - buy her or him so food made with real ingredients, things you would eat - Wellness, Halo, Innova, Evo, whatever. Figure it out for yourself, but please don't feed your cat this. It's garbage."

The oldest cat was diagnosed a couple of months ago with the beginning stages of chronic kidney disease.  His numbers didn't warrant being on prescription food yet, but we needed to start paying attention to things like protein and phosphorus levels in his food.  Because we have five cats, and some of them are nibblers eating four or five nuggets at a time, we decided to switch them all to an acceptable food for the oldest, so we picked the active longevity because it specifically mentioned kidney support and calories appropriate for less active older cats.<br /><br />Since we made the switch 6 weeks ago, all of the cats have gained weight.  This was fine for the little old guy as he was a bit underweight; not good for the rest of them.  Our other male went from a slightly chunky 18.5 lbs to an obese 21.25 lbs - almost three pounds in 6 weeks!  The 3 females gained between 1.5 to 2 pounds each.  We noticed them making a lot more visits to the food bowl, like they couldn't seem to get full.  We also saw a lessening of coat quality - lots of shedding even though they are brushed regularly (including with a furminator) and one developed bad dandruff.  The stools developed a really bad odor, although I do have to say nobody developed diarrhea which I am grateful for.  Most worrisome was that the lab results on the old guy came back with some of the kidney values of concern having worsened.<br /><br />I am very disgusted with Science Diet - they are actively fooling the public with the nutritional claims on the bags. One of the sites I researched on for chronic renal failure has charts detailing the nutritional breakdown of most of the various foods available.  If you compare the various Science diet formulae that have different health claims on them - the nutritional values for the components listed are all within a tenth of a point or two.  Basically from the nutritional analysis it appears that they are  the same base formula with maybe a slight difference in a vitamin or additive.  With other brands, such as innova or royal canin, there appears to be an actual difference between the different formulae.<br /><br />Now to deal with the weight gain, as well as the other problems we noted, we are switching foods again.  This time we are trying royal canin indoor mature.  Wish us luck."

I learned about this system and decided to give it a try, thinking I'd buy some reusable training pads instead of the ones made for this system (which were more than I wanted to pay).  That way we would be able to save some money and the earth a little bit as well.<br /><br />Then, I realized I could potentially skip the pee pads entirely and just replace our toilet training system with the Breeze litter box...on top of the toilet, sans tray (and toilet seat/lid/mounting parts).  This is exactly what I did this morning when I received the system, and the kitties were ecstatic not to have to use the wretched toilet training system anymore.  They took to it immediately... probably because they were glad to go back to a litter box and also because we had been using Feline Pine with them, so they were used to pellet-type litter.  So we're all happy... the kitties are peeing in the toilet, although they don't know it, and all we have to do is scoop the poo, which doesn't smell as bad when the kitties bury it.<br /><br />I was really hoping they would be able to use the toilet on their own, but I think we've reached a pretty good compromise.  I did have to cover up part of the grid with some clear mailing tape, however, because the corners of the rectangle grid did not quite fit over the oval toilet bowl.  Had to clean up a puddle of piddle after I realized I had miscalculated.  :P<br /><br />All that being said, it would be great if a company came out with a Breeze-like system made for toilets.

I was waiting for my appointment at Yale New Haven Hospital and viewing the hospital closed circuit TV which was explaining health tips. The topic changed to the benefits of green tea and it mentioned it's anti oxidant properties and the fact that it helps reduce belly fat!!. I do not have a real problem in this area as I am 5' 10 1/2"" tall and weighed 209 lbs. After surgery I had to watch my diet and with the help of Stash Green Tea consumed cold from a 32 once thermos at least three times weekly I have lost 17 lbs and inches from my belly area. TIP; Cut the string and tab off four tea bags and place in a 32 oz. thermos, top off with filtered water. You can refill with water all day or add one or two additional tea bags while leaving the others in the thermos. Keep refrigerated if possible. Ice cubes will rupture the tea bags. Try this for three months for at least three days a week or more and see if the belly isn't flatter!!"

I was a little concerned about all the reviews that said they had a fish smell and taste.  Also I was concerned about the texture, having read that they are rubbery. When they arrived I was surprised that the packages are so small. One pack will satisfy one person if it is meant as the main dish, however as a side it will be alright for two people.  I found that if you follow the directions on the package(which I did) there is no fishy taste or smell.  The product gets its flavor from the sauce you put on it.  As for the texture it is definitlty different.  It is a little rubbery and difficult to eat or seperate into servings unless I cut them into smaller sizes first.  It does fill you up as it is soluable fiber, it has no other nutritional benefits.  However I will continue to use this product as it is a great way to get additional fiber into the diet.

Their recent price increase is outrageous IMHO (I mean, how much coffee is really in there to justify the recent 15% or so increase?).  I've tried the My K-cup from Keurig.  It did ok, coffee was a little weak, and it was a bit of a hassle to swap out the holder and then cleaning out the grounds as well.<br /><br />I moved onto the EZ-cup pod holster, using tea filter bags.  This eliminated much of the mess, but the coffee quantity is a little low resulting in a weaker cup (but similar to the My K-cup).  Plus, I had to buy the bags and we're trying to save money here.<br /><br />Next came the solofill, but again, the coffee quantity is a little lower than I like.  Cleaning out the solofill isn't hard, but it takes longer than it should, due to the nooks/crannies in there.  Still better than the My K-cup as you don't have to pop out the holder.<br /><br />Ok, on to the the ekobrew.  They obviously put a lot of thought into the design of this thing.  The cutouts are exactly where they need to be and the water flows out more evenly thru the grounds.  Because of this design, there is a little more room in there for the grounds resulting in a better brew.  I've only used this a few times, but cleanup is easier than the My K-cup and solofill.  I would guess it's because the design is flatter on the bottom and the sides seem straighter.  Not quite as convenient as the EZ-cup, but it's a better cup and cheaper.<br /><br />I'll be looking into getting another one of these!"

Of course I generally break them in half before putting them in my mouth.  That way I can savor them longer.  The last order I placed in June 2012 was for 6 tins because I had run out of tins, and I hate to do that - leaving me without my favorite candy.  And to top it off, these peppermint sticks are low in fat.  What a bonus.  Do watch out for the shipping costs because they tend to add up the more tins you order as these tins are heavy.

Let the loaf sit in the bread machine for at least 20 minutes after it stops baking.

The initial comparison Vitamin Squeeze will draw in taste is to Kool Aid (and other fruit punches).  It actually tastes quite a bit like the regular red Kool-Aid, but not as sugary and nauseating.  It has a nice, pleasant Kool-Aid taste when used with the ""recipe"" on the bottle (which is one squeeze for every cup (8 oz) of water).<br /><br />The sweet taste is especially good for this reason: It's actually beneficial in a nutritional sense.  According to the label, Vitamin Squeeze contains 120% of your daily intake of Vitamin C along with different types of Vitamin B, Taurine, and electrolytes (like in Gatorade).  For this, it could be a good replacement to the typical fruit punches, sports drinks, etc., that so many kids have.  Vitamin Squeeze doesn't have all of the sugar and calories that those drinks have (which are some of the worst things you can give a kid).<br /><br />The label, in addition to the vitamin benefits, also claims some energy-drink qualities.  Well, it does have ""natural caffeine,"" but don't expect to get a Red Bull kick or anything like that.  I did notice an upkick in my post workout recovery though.  It may have been placebo, but it's worth noting if you want to treat this like a Gatorade replacement to replenish electrolytes after intense workouts.<br /><br />Now, for my only negative issue with Vitamin Squeeze: The bottle.  I'm hoping I received a dud with the packaging because, from the very beginning, it leaked from under the cap and left what looked like drips of blood all over my floor & countertops.  Since I do plan on trying this product again in the future, I'll update further if I have better or the same packaging."

So, I was happy to find them at Amazon this past July, 2012 and bought the case of six boxes.  Unfortunately, they didn't taste fresh and had an expiration date of Dec. 2012; that explained the stale taste, but I chose not to return them.  Instead, I nuke two in the microwave for 5 or 6 seconds and it sort of revives the flavor.<br /><br />Well, last week, Sept. 14, 2012, I found the Belgium Lu at my local supermarket and bought a single box.  That box expires Dec. 2013, over a year from now, and the cookies definitely taste better.  Moral of the story: Buy them where you can read the Expiration date.  I surmise that having a year or two shelf life should be about right."

Plus, the litter box does not smell as bad, and I feel better about giving them food without nasty byproducts.  This is described as human-quality food, though I haven't been brave enough to try, I believe it.  Instead of smelling like a bag of fast food that got stuck under the seat in my car for a month, this smells like chicken soup.<br /><br />We tried getting our boys onto Avoderm, which definitely made their coats shinier and softer, and even increased their activity level (hard to believe for these Bengals).  However, once the mix got to be over 50% Avoderm, they didn't like the taste.  Can't give a low rating to any cat food because of taste.<br /><br />One note about shipping-- the packaging has not been perfect, but it's not nearly as bad as some of the other reviewers say.

It's an odd concept, a spread made of cookies, but I'm glad that I didn't let that stop me from trying it.<br /><br />The label says that this is a ""European alternative to peanut butter.""  I completely disagree as it it only has the look and texture of peanut butter.  It smells and tastes just like the Biscoff cookies, but sweeter, with a hint of caramelized sugar and cinnamon.  It is much more like dulce de leche than peanut butter.<br /><br />This spread is good with ice cream; on pancakes, scones, and apples; or just eaten from a spoon as a nice treat after a meal.  A thin layer even salvaged the plain graham crackers I bought by mistake instead of the cinnamon honey variety.  It would also be good on cupcakes, waffles, or popovers.  Eating it on toast doesn't appeal to me but maybe with raisin bread it would be good.  It really is tasty and hard to resist, especially with milk or coffee.<br /><br />The basic recipe for Biscoff spread is speculoos cookies, canola oil, and sugar so it's not particularly healthy.  Each tablespoon has 88 calories with 52 of them from fat.  On the bright side, a tablespoon only has 33 mg of sodium.<br /><br />Ingredients:  Biscoff 57% (wheat flour, sugar, vegetable oils [one or more of soy bean oil, sunflower oil, canola oil, palm oil], soy flour, brown sugar, sodium bicarbonate, salt, cinnamon), canola oil, sugar, soy lecithin, citric acid."

It arrived in a padded mailing envelope, and inside that, the shampoo bottle was tightly taped inside a plastic bag. Good thing, because the inside of the plastic bag contained about a third of the shampoo, which had leaked from the bottle!  So, a different way of shipping this product is a must.<br /><br />Next, some more specific information about the shampoo itself:<br /><br />1)  The scent is very strong. (Best described as a fruity/floral.) I could smell it even before opening the mailer, and I thought that was because of the leakage, but the scent remained strong even after cleaning up the spill. If you don't like strongly scented products, this may bother you.<br /><br />2)  Bottle design is okay (product comes out a small hole in a flip-up cap), just not appropriate for the shipping method they use, as already mentioned.<br /><br />3) Product amount is 12.9 oz, and since you need about a half-dollar size amount, it should last awhile.<br /><br />4) Cleansing properties: It does not lather ""richly"", or offer a head full of bubbles, but rather has a creamy, low-sudsing consistency.  (Which is why I used that half-dollar size amount.) My scalp and hair did feel cleansed after use, even minus the big bubbles.<br /><br />5) Conditioning: I can't say whether my scalp was ""nourished"", but my hair DID have BIG volume after blow drying, and also felt smooth and healthy.<br /><br />However, the down-side for me, and the reason for only four-stars, is that, after two uses, I noticed some color-fading. Eeek! (My hair is colored once every 4-5 weeks, and I was only on week 2 of color when trying this shampoo. Usually, I use L'Oreal EverPure color care system shampoo.) Now, the color fading may be because I'm ""of a certain age"", and my hair doesn't hold color as long/well as it used to. Or maybe the change from my usual brand just looked ""different"" to me.<br /><br />In any case , I felt this product delivered on its promise to volumize and help with healthiness, but the color-fade was a concern for me. If necessary, I'll return again to add comments if the color fade becomes more noticeable."

It is definitely different and I might say worth trying out to see if you like it.

Zipp Fizz claims that it's a natural product and on its website says that it is sweetened with xylitol.  Xylitol is a natural sugar made from the birch tree, and used in Europe for over 100 years.  I use xylitol on a regular basis and agree that if it comes from the right source and not from China, where it's made from corn, it is healthy and has very good side effects such as cavity prevention.  But,on the ingredients list, xylitol is the last ingredient, meaning, that it is the smallest ingredient in the formula.  On the other hand Sucralose (also known as Splenda) is very high on the list of ingredients.  That's where the aftertaste is from.  If you don't care what you put in your body then this is a good product as it does work as advertised.  Why add Splenda if the xylitol is in there? Because the splenda is cheaper. So obviously there is no need for the xylitol other than to use it as a marketing ploy.  They know this and have told me that their new product - immune fizz - has no Splenda.  Why not take it out of the regular zipp fizz too and make it healthier too?  I was sucked into the purchase by the xylitol reference only to find the sucralose in the product.  I wonder what else they aren't saying?"

I bought <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0017WG180"">NOW Foods Stevia Liquid Extract Alcohol, 8 Ounce Bottle</a> three months later.  My motive was to compare these products and see which one is best for me.<br /><br />I will try to be as detailed as possible.  So again I am evaluating ""Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme"" and ""Now Foods: Better Stevia Original"".<br /><br />At first, I expected Better Stevia to be what the packaging described, a better alternative to Stevia drinkers.  I expected it to be exactly what they advertised in its packaging:<br /><br />-Better tasting<br />-Just as healthy<br /><br />etc.<br /><br />To compare them, I alternated an average of 6 drops into my morning coffee everyday.<br /><br />==Taste Evaluation==<br /><br />After everyday usage of these two products and after testing them extensively; I see no -significant- difference between the two in taste.  Please do take into consideration that I did not test these by serving suggestion amount (see Suggested Serving below).<br /><br />==Ingredients==<br /><br />Now let's talk about the ingredients.  Both products claim to be made with natural ingredients.  ""Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme""  lists ""natural flavors"" apart from ""Stevia extract"".  ""Now Foods Better Stevia Original"" lists ""water"", ""certified Organic Stevia extract"" and ""11% alcohol"".<br /><br />Sweet Leaf has quite an advantage, since it does not list alcohol as an ingredient.<br /><br />I wanted more evidence about ingredients.  I thought that Sweet Leaf was trying to pull as fast one, by passing alcohol as a ""natural flavor""; like many companies have done.<br /><br />So I visited the Sweet Leaf website and found this: ""SweetLeaf Stevia® Sweetener does not use chemicals, alcohols, solvents or enzymes at any stage of the extraction and purification process.""<br /><br />Bingo.  Sweet Leaf has -no alcohol-.<br /><br />==Suggested Serving and Packaging==<br /><br />""Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme"" serving suggestion is 5 to 8 drops and contains a dropper for easier administration of the product.  You can count exactly how many drops you're serving.  As long as you don't go beyond 7-8 drops it should not be bitter at all.<br /><br />""Now Foods Better Stevia Original"" serving suggestion is 1 to 4 drops and has a split-open cap that it's very messy.  You can't count by drops, usually it spills to the body of the container.  It is very difficult to measure exactly how much you're administering.  I found that many times the bitterness was noticeable due to not knowing how much I was using.<br /><br />Final evaluation from 1 to 5.<br /><br />Taste:<br /><br />""Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme"" = 5<br /><br />""Now Foods Better Stevia Original"" = 5<br /><br />Ingredients:<br /><br />""Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme"" = 5<br /><br />""Now Foods Better Stevia Original"" = 4<br /><br />Suggested Serving and Packaging:<br /><br />""Sweet Leaf: Liquid Stevia Vanilla Creme"" = 5<br /><br />""Now Foods Better Stevia Original"" = 2<br /><br />All in all Sweet Leaf wins, for several reasons.  The packaging makes it very easy to serve the product properly. When I used the Sweet Leaf dropper with the Better Stevia I found that 4 drops weren't bitter.

I love the basil chicken (ga kra prao) that is served at Thai restaurants and have tried to replicate it myself with no luck. I am pleased to say that the sauce included in this product replicates it perfectly.<br /><br />My tip is to use ground chicken rather than sliced. One sauce packet goes perfectly with 1/2 pound ground chicken. I also prefer jasmine rice rather than the included rice noodles.<br /><br />Which brings me to the expensive part. If you do what I do, you're basically paying for a packet of sauce. And depending on how much you eat, and how many there are of you, that could mean multiple packets per meal.<br /><br />Anyway, to sum up, I recommend you give it a try using ground chicken and then decide whether it's ever worth it to buy it again."

Secondly, the product was way sweeter than Naked, which leads me to believe that they somehow add sugar to the product, because there can't be such a variation from one coconut water to another, if both claim to be all natural, blah, blah, blah. To be specific, O.N.E. has 3 more grams of sugar than Naked per 11.2 ounce serving. Because of the sugary taste, it makes the water less crisp and refreshing (and healthy) than Naked.

It has no fat, which makes it easy to add to any diet.  And if you are like me, andnot a fan of leafy green vegies, it masks all those horrible rabbit-loving green tastes.<br /><br />This glaze can be expensive in the stores--and hard to find (at least in my area).

When I had a chance to order a case of the Double Spice Chai on Amazon I made my purchase and have been happily drinking it at breakfast for the last couple of months. I make a large double-sized mug-full using two tea bags and I drink it fairly sweet and with a considerable amount of milk or Half and Half, since that is closer to the traditional way to prepare chai as I understand it. I do like it a lot, but I have to agree with the reviewer who commented that the double spice tends to overpower the strength of the black tea component and that Stash would do well to use a heartier variety of black tea in their formulation of this product.

I gave it 4 instead of 5 because it seems the amount you get out of each individual package (quite a nice touch to have it in single well protected packages) is really not enough and I end up using a few of these packages for each creation, so one can only sigh as each individual box containing, I think (therefore I am), ten individual packages are gone faster than you can say ""Where is the Beef?!"". Besides that reflection of how much of a ""tight-wad"" I can be I must say this product is a lot tastier than most out there waiting in the aisles. The fact that the Broth is a thick gooey concentrate of beef only adds to my pleasure. Smells like what it claims and that is one more plus. I have been able to use them quite successfully in several ways: Stews, Soups, Sauces, on top of quality beef while cooking at high heat (stir fry renderings, per say). I have tried the cubes, the glass containers (above the cubes in quality, that is for sure), the powder form (or was that chicken, I am getting dizzy...) and I like this product. To test it I boiled a cup of water or so, added one of the packages (a little later another one), some herbs that go well with this kind of broth, a touch of fresh salsa and drank it like a cup of soup. No complaints. One package is rarely enough but the flavor and the final results all point out to an above average offering. Wish it was more quantity (then again if wishes were horses beggars would be riding) and now that I know about Savory Choice Beef Broth Concentrate, 5.1-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 4) I am going to buy more and I should say I have purchased a similar product in the past but not as gooey, a little more solid and comes in a plastic container and makes about a gallon of liquid, from a place where I buy the best Seafood Bases I have found in this great country.  I know how important bases are to really be able to put out a superior tasting dish so is added on the food budget and this product does not disappoint. 4 Stars!"

I made two test batches to see if it was the salt I was using to make my vanilla salt but they both have that weird sour, rancid smell. I've made vanilla salt before so I know what it's supposed to smell and taste like. Unfortunately, even after a few days, this smell isn't going away. I was really looking forward to making jars of vanilla salt to give out as cheap gifts. But now I need to go buy more vanilla beans to replace these which is going to end up costing me. I'm so disappointed. I haven't cooked with these seeds so I don't know if the taste and smell transforms with heat or with any other mixed in ingredient.

Below is some info on green tea I found on the web. And btw my comment to the reviewer who gave a one star review and complained about the taste; I don't find it repulsive at all<br /><br />What makes tea increase weight loss? According to scientific studies, it is the catechins, caffeine and theanine that makes green tea an effective weight loss tool.<br /><br />In particular, scientists have found that EGCG (the most active and abundant of catechins) and caffeine are especially important. They fight obesity in at least 7 ways.<br /><br />Method #1:<br />Boosts Metabolism<br /><br />There are 3 kinds of fat. They can be found beneath the skin, in the body organs and in the muscles.<br /><br />Brown adipose tissue is a layer of fat beneath the skin that has the ability to generate heat. Scientists found that green tea stimulates the heat burning process (called thermogenesis) much more than caffeine alone would.<br /><br />Green Tea Metabolism - How Many More Calories?<br /><br />Method #2:<br />Burns Fat<br /><br />Fat is an excellent source of energy in humans. Beta-oxidation is a process during which fat is broken down to provide energy. Scientists found that green tea burns fat by stimulating the beta-oxidation process.<br /><br />Green Tea Burn Fat<br /><br />Method #3:<br />Prevents Fat Storage<br /><br />An adipocyte cell is a fat cell or connective tissue that is involved in the synthesis and storage of fat. Scientists found that green tea prevents fat cells from multiplying and enlarging.<br /><br />In an animal study, scientists found that green tea increases weight loss by blocking the actions of enzymes involved in the synthesis and storage of fat.<br /><br />A 2006 study conducted by Donald Danforth Plant Science Center discovered that green tea may help reduce fat storage by moderating your body's production of hormone insulin. The scientists discovered that green tea does this by blocking the production of glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH).<br /><br />This is important because insulin plays a key part in converting glucose (blood sugar) into fat.<br /><br />Method #4:<br />Reduces Food Craving<br /><br />When you eat sugary food, your blood sugar level spikes up. This triggers a large release of insulin to move the glucose out of blood into cells for storage.<br /><br />Because your body can overreact by producing too much insulin, this can cause a sharp dip in glucose level afterwards. Low sugar levels increase your cravings, hunger, and mood swings, and reduces energy level. End result? You crave more sugary food, causing the vicious cycle to repeat itself.<br /><br />Green tea, by regulating your blood sugar levels, helps to reduce food cravings and hunger pangs.<br /><br />Green Tea and Blood Sugar<br /><br />Method #5:<br />Blocks Dietary Fat Absorption<br /><br />Another green tea weight loss secret...<br /><br />Digestive enzymes act on the foods we eat so that the body can absorb them. According to a 2006 peer review study by Wolfram, green tea reduces carbohydrate and fat absorption by blocking the actions of these enzymes.<br /><br />Method #6:<br />Regulates Glucose Uptake<br /><br />A study conducted by Ashida found that drinking green tea increases the glucose uptake by skeletal muscles and reduces the glucose uptake by fat tissue.<br /><br />End result? You are able to exercise longer, which will help you burn more calories and fat. By exercising more, you develop more muscles, which will help you maintain an active lifestyle.<br /><br />Green Tea Diet and Exercise<br /><br />Method #7:<br />Synergism with Caffeine<br /><br />Ready for the final green tea weight loss magic? Now consider this: When is 1+1=3?<br /><br />Studies conducted by scientists Dulloo and Rumpler found that caffeine and catechins benefit from one another's presence. Together, they burn more calories than each compound is on its own.<br /><br />Green tea, including caffeine, greatly increases and prolongs the heat burning effect. It helps you burn more calories even when you are sleeping!<br /><br />Diet suggestion #1<br /><br />Avoid diet drinks ans sugar substitutes. That right avoid them as much as possible. Though they help prevent you from gaining weight,they also PREVENT YOU FROM LOSING WEIGHT.<br /><br />Diet suggestion #2<br /><br />Eat protein and only proteins for breakfast. This sets up your metabolism to burn fat the rest of the day. Avoid ""breakfast"" drinks as they contain sugar and any carbs too.<br /><br />Diet suggestion #3<br /><br />This will be the most difficult; keep the room temperature as low as you can tolerate. Your body will burn fat to maintain it's metabolism and body temp. I prefer 64 degrees."

However, whole grains should be an important part of our diets, and I'll bet your Girl Scout cookies and the Nutter Butters are not made with whole grains. I love peanut butter and I really appreciate how much peanut butter flavor there in these granola bars, but the calories per serving are only 180. For anyone who has never had a Nature Valley granola bar, they come 2 in a pouch and 2 are considered one serving. In size I would say the pouch would equal 4 small/medium cookies. A tip on the crunchiness: These almost crumble when you bite into them, and depending on where you are eating, that can be inconvenient. Here is what I do with ALL of the NV granola bars, whether I'm at a table, in a recliner, or driving down the road. First, I break both the bars into 3 crosswise. I then break each of those thirds once, crosswise. Then I open the pouch along the lengthwise seam.

Not so!  My package arrived looking like a small corn army contingent sitting in a low cardboard case and wrapped tightly in plastic.  I looked closely at each can and found no dents.  Now that being said, if you DO find dents, as I've learned from another reviewer and my own recent experiences, you can tell Amazon.  Granted, it's a little extra work.  There is no quick button to push under your Account.  You'll need to write them a message to get a replacement.  Another reviewer said dented cans are to be expected but I don't think we should lower our expectations.  It's not like these are charity foods Amazon is giving away and we can't be too particular!  Amazon must know we can take our food dollars elsewhere and that they need to give shoppers incentive to take the risk of buying groceries online, be it in low prices, quick shipping, or great customer service when something goes amiss.<br /><br />But you want to know how the corn tastes.  It's okay, perfectly fine, a little crunchy.

Way better than those ""Fruit Roll-ups"" of old times.  Would definitely recommend to anyone with kids or infants instead of other sweetened snacks (that would probably contain some kind of weird chemical)...this stuff is all natural.<br /><br />The 9 grams of sugar may be a bit much for an 2-3 year old to have more than one or two per day (unless you don't mind them running around with their arms above their head, bouncing off walls, and yelling with a big smile on their face.)<br /><br />On a final note - this review is for the Strawberry flavor.  While it does have sweetness and light strawberry flavor, it is rather ""tart"" for a strawberry.  In fact, the ingredients don't actually list ""strawberries"" anywhere in them:  Organic Apple Puree, Organic Apple Juice Concentrate, Organic Flavors, Pectin, colored with Fruit and Vegetable Juice.  With that said...the apple puree/apple juice taste like they were Granny Smith or maybe Gravensteins.<br /><br />So, while not exactly tasting like a fresh picked strawberry by any stretch of the imagination (hence the 4 stars rather than 5), they are very tasty.  (If given a Strawberry one without knowing which flavor it was prior, I don't think everybody would agree that it's strawberry.)  At any rate, I will certainly buy these in the future - will try other flavors to see if they all have ""tart apple with hint of &lt;flavor>"" flavored."

However, I do occasionally need it, so when I saw this product I was ecstatic.<br /><br />The first time I used it, a few years ago, the taste was wonderful but there was an issue with clumping. While I appreciated that they wanted to keep it as natural as possible, most of the packets contained a wet little mass that I had to peel away from the packet. Messy and not convenient. I contacted the company and learned this was something they were working to correct.<br /><br />I tried again some time later, and the results are everything I wanted. Pure lemon taste (unlike those nasty concentrated bottles of so-called lemon juice you find in the produce department) with nice free flowing crystals. Bear in mind that one packet equals out to a teaspoon of lemon juice, so this isn't something I'd recommend getting if you are looking to make a pitcher of lemonade. However, if you're like me and like the occasional hint of lemon in a glass of water or a bit of lemon in your tea, it's fantastic.<br /><br />Just how lemony is this lemon? Well, the other day a friend brought over some huge raw oysters. Personally, my favorite way to eat them is with just a dash of lemon juice. I had no lemon juice but got the idea in my head to open a couple of packets and mix with a couple tablespoons of water. My friend took a sip and was shocked because it tasted like we'd just squeezed some fresh lemons. We downed all the oysters with nothing but the True Lemon and didn't even reach for the hot sauce. Fantastic product.<br /><br />Other favorite uses: Sprinkle on cubed steak and serve with avocado salsa. Place sliced apples in a ziplock bag, add one packet of True Lemon and one packet of stevia (or any other sweetener)...keeps the apples from browning and adds a bright hint-of-lemon taste. Sprinkle on fish right before serving. Great on a cream cheese bagel with a little dash of powdered sugar. Great for when you want to add the taste of lemon but perhaps not the water content of lemon juice."

Our breeder recommended this dog food.  She did well on the old formula, except for what we THOUGHT were seasonal hot spots where she would chew the hair off of the insides of her legs and also her behind.<br /><br />Since purchasing my latest bag about three weeks ago she has been throwing up, having frequent burping which smells of vomit, having horribly smelly flatulance, and I had to clean my carpet from a poop accident two days ago.<br /><br />I was initially just upset to find that my latest bag had been down-sized from 40 lbs. to 35 lb.  I sent an e-mail telling them that I would rather pay more for something than have it down-sized.  Their response was :<br /><br />""Our economy and industry is faced with challenging times, commodities and energy cost are at an all time high and continue to sky rocket.""<br /><br />They ended their response with this condescending comment :<br /><br />""We have also had a lot of positive feedback from our women shoppers who love the new sizes as they can handle them much better when unloading them from their car.""<br /><br />After talking with my dog's breeder, I discovered that the formula had been changed and that her dogs and many other breeders' dogs had been having problems with the new formula.  The ""Canidae Team"" didn't mention the formula change when I asked them about the down-sizing.  That would have been nice.<br /><br />So, I started searching the internet and found more horror stories of dogs becoming sick with the new formula.  Plus, many dog owners were upset that Canidae did not make much of an effort to inform their customers of the new formula change.<br /><br />I sent another e-mail to Canidae regarding the formula change, their lack of informing their customers about it, and how my dog has been reacting to it.  They didn't address my comments about how it was making my dog and others sick, they just stated that they did their best to post their changes on the internet.  From what I have been reading in posts, that is not the case.  I also found out through forum postings on the internet that Canidae is now in partnership with Diamond Pet Foods.  Diamond was involved in the dog food recalls where dogs were dying from the tainted food.  Maybe since the recall and deaths, Diamond has cleaned up their act and has more stringent guidelines and inspections but who wants to take that chance when it comes to our beloved dogs?"

When I saw Red Leaf Tea's Eggnog matcha, hey.. this might have some potential to have an eggnog on my terms!<br />Out of the package, the eggnog matcha smells slightly eggy and spicy.<br /><br />Prepared as a traditional hot matcha, I can taste the eggnog, but in matcha form! The base of bold green tea is there, with a eggy taste second, with a vanilla and nutmeg hit. This matcha is also slightly sweet. No bitterness or astringency.<br /><br />Now the best part, eggnog matcha prepared as a latte! I made mine cold, whisking 1/2tsp of egg nog matcha into some light soy milk and a little sweetener. I find the eggy taste is the strongest! I love eggy taste! Next is the creamy vanilla and a hint of spice.<br /><br />The only thing missing for this to be perfectly like eggnog is the consistency. This might go well with a thicker soy milk (like the very vanilla Silk soy milk) or whisk in a little instant vanilla pudding mix. Of course, this egg nog matcha latte is green, so more festive!<br /><br />Tea peeps, give this one a shot!"

Here are some interesting facts: Cat's can't digest corn...in fact, they are obligatory carnivores and only eat up until the point of reaching optimal nutrition. When I fed my cat the science diet he ate ALL THE TIME, constantly. After switching him over to Castor and Pollux Indoor Cat Formula he eats much less now.<br /><br />Also, By-Product means just that...beaks, feathers, toe-nail clippings, meat not suitable for human consumption, dead animals, etc. -- Totally not worth the $$$ ...it's cheaper just to dig in the trash and puree it yourself (doesn't sound so appealing does it??). Science Diet is notorious for implying superior quality products when they are in fact no better than all the other terrible pet food you find. Don't let your vet fool you either- vets usually get a 40% cut from Hill's to sell you their cat food.<br /><br />My recommendation is to use common sense and to do some research. Try brands like Newmans Own or Castor and Pollux as they have wholesome ingredients and a proven track record.<br /><br />I later called the shelter only to hear that they are required to feed the animals Science Diet as it is donated and they have a special arrangement with Petsmart to house their animals in their in store adoption centers.

Actually, peeling the filets off is pretty simple just do it under running water and start from the head end and peel off one filet at a time - takes about 10 seconds per fish.  As others have said, they are not as salty as oil packed because you really need to rinse them off.  Also, soaking these fish first is completely unnecessary.  Just run them under water while you peel and they are perfectly fine and not salty once they are boneless - soaking in milk or water for twenty to thirty minutes does nothing but waste time."

Porter ""Soon To Be Fit!""",58,69,5,1318118400,OMG It WORKS!,"I have been using this product for almost a week now and my only complaint is that I didn't find pit about it sooner! First, a bit about myself. I am a 45 year old black woman, suffering from gout, constipation, fibrmyalgia, muscle cramps, brain fog and horrible insomnia, along with chronic depression and yes I am overweight, yes folks I am a hot mess!<br /><br />I found out about CALM from an article about the five vitamins and supplements that our bodies need the most, I was already taking four of them, so that made me feel good and when I read about CALM, I was like great this may be just what I need, especially after I read about all of the possible benefits that were to be achieved after taking CALM.<br /><br />Well, let me tell you how it has helped me in under a week. I am sleeping through the night, my mood is improving and that in of it self is a miracle. I have been suffering from depression for over 20 years and nothing helped, this is helping. I am able to think a bit clearer and turn off my brain, which in turn is also helping me sleep!<br /><br />Another major benefit is relief of muscle pain and cramps, especially after exercising! I did a particularly tough workout the other day, well hell any workout when you're fat can be tough, but this one consisted of weight training, cardio and ab work. I fully expected that I would be in horrible pain the next morning, but I wasn't as a matter of fact, I felt great! This also, seems to be helping with my fibromyalgia too.<br /><br />Now, the biggest benefit so far is the relief from my contipation! If I went once a week, I considered myself lucky. I had tried everything under the sun to get things moving so to speak, and either it would work for a while and then nothing, or worse yet nothing would happen at all. Any one that has suffered from constipation, knows now horrible it can be and how miserable you can become, both emotionally and physically. Well, since I have been taking CALM, I go two sometimes three times a day! I feel so much lighter, my friends and family always said I was full of crap and I guess they were right!<br /><br />I guess after reading my review you are thinking either she is being paid for this or it really works, well it is definitely the latter! It is working for me and I believe it will work for you too, try it what have you got to lose besides a crappy mood, sleepless night, a lot of crap and cramps? Jeez, I think $23.00 is a pretty fair trade off don't you.<br /><br />One more thing the dosage that I am using is two teaspoons at night and one teaspoon in the morning, both with 3 teaspoons of benefiber mixed in  girl still needs her fiber! and BTW it's a store brand).

I do remember a dog food recall a couple years back where dogs were getting very sick due to a contamination of sorts, but Canidae was never part of the recalled list, as far as I know.  I know all about gas, I have labs, no matter what you feed them they have some sort of gas.  I do not feed my dogs table scraps and use Milk Bones for treats.

I've been using the Brother's bean for about 10 years now and have never found any better for my Rancilio Silvia.  This Lavazza is way too smooth for my taste but it is probably the best I have found during my 6 month search.  It also provides excellent crema but I ground it a little too fine which seems to promote extra crema.  I am still looking for a stout, very flavorful decaf expresso for my afternoon and evening lattes.  If anyone has any suggestions for me I would greatly appreciate it.  I have spent a small fortune trying to find a very flavorful decaf expresso.  Additionally, the Lavazza is decaffeinated using the very safe Swiss Water method (no chemicals).  If you are looking for a very smooth expresso this medium roast Lavazza is very good."

Well, the first cup of Marley coffee did not have any burnt flavor to it.  This is a great one for someone who has a lifetime of drinking tea and wants to try coffee.

But this cup lacks presence and is just a bit too subtle for me<br /><br />The next cup was far better, with some character to it, but a little bit burnt.

The below feeding schedule is modified slightly (sometimes only two feedings a day, maybe half the amount of dry, etc.)  If your cat has a sensitive tummy, it is best to feed more frequent, smaller meals each day.<br /><br />The 7 and 13 yo boys get about 1/4 cup dry per day.<br />The 17 yo girl gets about 1/8 cup dry per day.<br /><br />I then split one can between all three twice a day.  When the can is first opened, I add little hot water to the wet food.  This guarantees a consistent texture between different batches,  The remainder of the can is covered with a plastic lid, and placed in the refrigerator.  I then later pull out (don't leave in fridge for more than 2 days), separate into three servings, and mix at least 1/8 cup hot water.  Then, nuke for 5 to 7 seconds (to warm up), and walla, a gravy mix meal for kitties.<br /><br />I can verify 100% that their health improved greatly after switching from the cheap, grocery store dry.  Its the only reason Baby Girl is still alive.

Johnson ""Eugene J""",2,2,2,1339286400,"If you like your cashews oily, you may love these -.","I have purchased a lot of cashews from Amazon but this was my first experience with this brand. I was very happy with the nuts I had been getting and I tried this one for just two reasons: [1] The brands I usually order were out of stock and [2] among the the reasonably priced cashews, this one had the best reviews. I note that one review did say they were very oily but, in the end, that reviewer gave the product a 5 star rating. Well, that reviewer was certainly correct about one thing: these nuts are very oily. The walls of the package were so oil coated that I could barely see the nuts inside. My immediate reaction was to contact Amazon for a return label. But the site said food products were not returnable. I decided to call because I thought that there was significant misrepresentation of the product and that they would make an exception for that. Then I discovered that Amazon no longer takes phone calls to Customer Service!!! While I am surprised and a bit unhappy that Amazon has cut off calls to Customer Service, their ""no return policy"" on foods bothers me even more because the result is that anyone who calls their product a food gets a free pass on the requirement for an accurate description of the item. In the case of these cashews, the picture in the product description shows the nuts inside the container very  clearly, whereas they are barely visible through the  oil film on the inside of the package.<br />  Well, I decided to try to make the best of it, so I emptied the nuts onto paper towels, as the reviewer mentioned above had done. and dried them off as well as I could. Unfortunately, the remaining oil had an old taste that was definitely not pleasant.<br />  I have rated this product at 2 stars just because I have not tried all the cashew brands at Amazon and there may well be some that are still worse.<br />  In fairness to Emerald Harmony, these are the only oil roasted cashews I have purchased.[Oil is not mentioned by them and most other brands are dry roasted]<br />  And in fairness to Amazon, I want to say that this is the only product I have purchased from them where i have been unhappy with the final outcome."

I am a person that can't leave well enough alone when it comes to directions or recipes. For instance I feel that if you make this according to their directions you get sort of a pudding consistency rather than mousse. I use about half of the milk, making it very thick, then I FOLD in some Cool Whip OR stiffly whipped whipping cream.  You get the sugar with the Cool Whip, but not much.  With the whipping cream you get the fat but no sugar and no carbs. I sweeten it lightly with some Splenda.  Now if you really want to add some luciousness, cut the milk by about a 1/4 C. and add 1/4 C. Coffee Liqueur when you are mixing it all up.  You can adjust to your own taste, but remember it is liquid, so subtract the milk for how much liqueur you add. Beat like crazy! Then FOLD in the cream. Once the mouse is done to your favored consistency, set aside. Take some Nabisco or any other chocolate wafers and into an 8X10 or 8X8 baking dish add one layer of the wafers and then scoop some of the mousse on top of that and smooth. Repeat until you end with at the top with mousse. Cover and refig for several hours (6-or how ever many you can stand, longeer the better) and then cut into pieces. Oh Man is this good!

The Jr Carousel Gumball machine is nice, but I am here to review the gumballs. They seem to be lacking in the flavor department, and are also pricey. Yes, they are very sweet, but they don't have very much in terms of actual flavor. All you get is the artificial sweetness. The intense taste does not last long, but this is true with all gumballs, sugar free or not. Most commercial gumballs are brightly colored and each color gumball has a different flavor; the surprise of getting a different flavor experience every time is part of the allure of putting quarters into the gumball machine. Not so with the Carousel Sugarfree gumballs: while the Carousel sugar free gumballs contain a variety of bright colors, I have yet to detect any difference in flavor between say a pink, red, orange, yellow, green, blue, or white gumball. No assorted fruits or mints, the only flavor present in these gumballs is simply the sugar-free sweet. While they do taste good, they lose their flavor quickly and get a little boring after a while."

Pardon me, but I had to laugh when reading one reviewer's comment that said the product helped her leg cramps but didn't do anything for her sleeplessness. She readily awarded the product a mediocre three stars.<br /><br />Holistic alternatives are of utmost importance, especially--especially as we advance in years. I highly recommend this gluten-free product. You might be surprised at how little you require. Starting with half a teaspoon daily you increase or decrease as might be necessary. Soon you discover your proper dosage.<br /><br />Directions are unclear as to the amount of water to be used: ""Place powder in a glass or mug,"" it says. ""Add 2-3 oz of hot water. Let it fizz, then stir until dissolved. Fill with warm or cold water and enjoy. You can also simply add Natural CALM to a glass or bottle of cold water.""<br /><br />Got it? Neither do I. It's confusing at best. Just how much water to how much powder? It seems that they leave this for us to decide.<br /><br />Then there's the problem with this two-inch wide container. The size and shape may be suitable for stacking on store shelves, but not for home use. You need something wider. Consequently, I transfer the contents into something more sensible. Now I can utilize a measuring spoon, a measuring spoon for the sake of accuracy.<br /><br />Consistent results are what we desire and consistent results require accurate measurements. My dosage being precisely half a teaspoon, I use water (at room temperature) in one measured cup. Directions advise us to heat the water, but I myself do not find that extra chore necessary. I stir and let it settle. Then down the hatch.<br /><br />Need I mention that Natural CALM contains no yeast, dairy, egg, soy, wheat, sugar, starch, preservatives, artificial color or flavors? No fructose added. For further information call customer service at (866) 416-9216.<br /><br />Take charge of your health. Live life to the fullest."

Sriracha is a hot sauce with flavor -- it livens up every dish you put it on.""<br /><br />Once only found on Thai or Vietnamese restaurant tables, a bottle of Sriracha (sree-RAH-cha) Hot Chili Sauce is now a telltale sign of a great eatery, whether it is on a sidewalk hot dog stand, a family hamburger joint or my favorite Asian restaurant.<br /><br />Last year, New York Journal News reporter Kara Newman provided some background about the condiment nicknamed ""Thai ketchup."" Here's an excerpt:<br /><br />[[The two most commonly-found brands are Huy Fong, which sports a white rooster on the label, and Shark. (Supposedly, the shark is in homage to the shark-infested waters off the coast of Sriracha). Shark brand is made in Thailand and is used widely there as well as imported to U.S. stores and restaurants. Huy Fong is made in California by a Vietnamese immigrant, David Tran, and is the U.S. favorite.]]<br /><br />Sriracha is made of sun ripened chilies that are ground into a smooth paste with garlic. The sauce is nearly as thick as ketchup, which makes the squeeze bottle a handy way to deliver a spicy kick to your favorite foods. Speaking of ketchup, a little sriracha can add a nice kick to ketchup or your favorite dipping sauce without overpowering the other ingredients.<br /><br />Newman's story featured recipes were adapted from Greg Gilbert, Jackson & Wheeler.<br /><br />Sriracha Remoulade<br /><br />1 cup mayonnaise<br />1/4 cup sriracha<br />2 tablespoons red wine vinegar<br /><br />Whisk together until smooth. Serve as a dipping sauce with fried calamari rings.<br /><br />Fried Calamari<br /><br />1/2 cup calamari<br />1 cup milk<br />1 cup flour<br />1/2 cup semolina<br />Vegetable oil for frying<br />Salt and pepper<br /><br />Soak calamari rings in milk for about 20 minutes; drain.<br /><br />In a bowl, combine the flour and semolina. Dredge the calamari in the flour mixture, and shake off the excess. Heat the oil to 350 degrees, and fry the calamari until golden brown. Season with salt and pepper and serve with Sriracha Remoulade.<br /><br />Sriracha Spicy Buffalo Wings<br /><br />6 chicken wings<br />Oil for frying<br />3 tablespoons Frank's Red Hot Sauce<br />1 tablespoons sriracha<br />1 tablespoons butter, softened<br />Baby mache or other lettuce to garnish<br /><br />Fry the chicken wings until crispy. In a bowl, combine the red-hot sauce, sriracha, and butter. Toss the wings in the sauce and serve. Garnish with baby mache or other lettuce.<br /><br />In summary, I grew up with pepper, salt and Tabasco pepper sauce on the table for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Did sriracha replace my bottle of Tabasco? Yes. Sriracha is hotter but with a light, sweet finish that sets it apart from the vinegar tang of other pepper sauces.<br /><br />Rating: Five stars"

My veggie mix consisted of yellow onion, cauliflower, broccoli, pasilla chile peppers, and jalepeno peppers.  All cut into 1"" - 1.5"" pieces except for the chiles which were sliced into 0.25"" rings.<br /><br />I roasted the chicken and removed the skin.  I then sauteed the veggies in a large wok with some olive oil.  Once the veggies were near done I added the large bag of Rendang curry sauce, the packet of dried coconut milk powder, and a cup of water.  The sauce mixed with the ingredients well and when all the veggies were thoroughly coated I added the chicken thighs and gently mixed to coated them as well.  Although I did not have rice on my plates there would have been enough sauce to drizzle on the rice without the sauce being watery.  A pasta would have worked well in place of rice.<br /><br />The sauce came out very flavorful without overwhelming the the vegetables or chicken.  The coconut powder -- of which I had some reservations -- added a rich coconut flavor without any chemical or chalkiness.<br /><br />This curry sauce kit made a delicious curry stir-fry dinner last night that was good enough to have again for lunch today.

544094,544095,B001EO5PBK,A3GSX96YOYLSVN,Noemata,1,2,5,1303084800,Something more than just NaCl,"Our household consumes very little salt as such (other than the salt that is included in other substances such as soy sauce).  For the ""big jobs"" (brining a turkey, for example), we use Diamond Kosher salt, but for SEASONING we have for the past decade or so used only Belamandil Flor de Sal.  Where taste is the paramount criterion, we have found no equal to Portuguese Flor de Sal.<br /><br />As with other sea salts where the place of harvesting is specifically designated, such as Fleur de Sel from the region around Nantes, France, or Maldon salt from Britain, or Trapani salt from Sicily, it is the components of the salt that are not sodium chloride (NaCl) that distinguish Flor de Sal from other seasoning salts.  Although nothing has been added by human hands to the Flor de Sal that has been harvested from the ocean, at least four percent of Belamandil Flor de Sal comprises minerals that are not NaCl, and that four percent makes all the difference.  In case your mind's eye conjures visions that the non-NaCl component is the garbage that you may have seen dumped into the Mediterranean, put your fears to rest.  The coast of the Algarve region of Portugal, where Belamandil Flor de Sal is harvested, is on the Atlantic side of the Straits of Gibraltar, a part of a very large and self-healing Atlantic Ocean ecosystem.<br /><br />Also, like the French Fleur de Sel, the Portuguese Belamandil Flor de Sal is only the ""flower"" of the salt, skimmed from surface blooms, rather than, as many sea salts are, evaporated from large quantities of sea water that have been scoured from varying depths of the ocean.  Flor de Sal's surface blooms have been exposed to direct unfiltered sunshine (they disappear in rainstorms), a natural purifying process.  The process causes the salt to form small thin wafers rather than clumpy amorphous granules, and that shape causes the Flor de Sal to have a tactile but quickly yielding crunch that is very different from chomping down on grains of ordinary table salt.<br /><br />As gourmet foods go, Flor de Sal is a great bargain.  For the price of only enough gasoline for a very few days of an urban commute to work, you can buy more than a full pound of Flor de Sal, which will go a LONG way.  You will enjoy the Flor de Sal much more than the commute, I guarantee you."

I keep a jar of this at home as well as at work and it's the perfect addition to have with an apple or celery as a snack and it makes for a rocking Almond Butter & Jelly sandwich.  One of my favorite foods!"

I cannot speak to the other flavors, but the Chicken and Broccoli dinner was very bland.  It's as if Kraft was trying not to offend anyone's taste buds by creating a dish that didn't have a distinctive taste.  It that was the case... they've succeeded.  The consistency was also a bit disappointing, a bit too creamy for my tastes and the broccoli was hard to find.  It's in there, but not in abundance.  Overall, I don't think I'll seek this out at the grocery store."

The well designed and clearly written label, however, came askew and wrinkled as it is printed in a plastic paper-like material that seems to easily slip around the two large indentations on both sides of the container.<br /><br />The cashews themselves were of an excellent quality, with superb size, texture and freshness. The flavor experience, on the other hand, is open to interpretation. I have never used much salt in my diet so I found them salty and the pepper aftertaste marred the cashew flavor to the point of masking it. In other words, I could pretty much only taste salt and pepper with a hint of cashew. Other nuts, such as peanuts and almonds, bear seasoning better than cashews therefore the flavor concept might work better if understated. Because of my particular lack of exposure to salt I double checked my opinion with several family members and friends and without any input on my part they all pretty much agreed with me: the seasoning combo was too much for the cashews, albeit they seemed great to eat while drinking beer.<br /><br />They have 270 mg of sodium and 2.5g of saturated fat.

The only way to get gravy out of the bottle to where the dog can get it is by squeezing the bottle to force the gravy out around the edges and letting the dog lick the gravy off the surface (kind of defeats the purpose of bothering with the roller ball). I let my dog lick this treat for two sessions, but when I went back the third, the roller jammed so no matter how hard I squeezed, none of the gravy inside was coming out. I stood the bottle upright and pushed down on the ball to try to loosen it from the bottle top edge and let more flow through. This seemed to get the flow going again for 2-3 rough squeezes, but it shortly jammed again. I can still move the roller ball around with my fingers, and there will be a little gravy stuck to the part of the ball I move into the open, but it's not working as it was the first two times. There is still 2-3 tablespoons of product left in the bottle. Sorry, but I'm not going to sit there and manually roll the ball around with my fingers or forever tinker with pushing down on the ball so my dog can lick a miniscule amount of gravy at a time. I've checked for anything blocking the area between the bottle end and roller ball, but haven't seen anything likely to stop the flow or rolling (no dried clumps, etc). The convenience is lost if the gravy doesn't come out by itself from squeezing the bottle and the roller ball can't roll with the dog's tongue alone.<br /><br />I would recommend not using this over any carpet or floor surfaces you don't want to risk getting stained since there will likely be dripping. The gravy (when it did come out from squeezing the bottle) comes out from all sides of the ball at once instead of from one point where the dog can focus, so depending on which side your dog likes to lick, it might not catch the gravy from the side that isn't being licked right away in time to catch the gravy before it falls to the floor.<br /><br />The taste seems to be rated middle to low by my dog. My dog loves bacon flavored treats (can't get enough Beggin' Strips) and ate this product up readily enough in the beginning when it was new, but it's since become clear he isn't crazy about it. Now he's seen what this gravy is about, he might take one or two licks then walk away. I have to keep calling him back to encourage him to finish up and take another lick. I don't think I would be able to get him to finish the bottle even if it were flowing properly.<br /><br />I'm not sure I would bother buying more of these unless I was assured of the reliability of the bottle not jamming again and the roller working properly. I would love to see some sort of refillable roller bottle offered so I could fill it with some cheap homemade gravy instead (there is no way to refill these bottles yourself) since I do like the concept of limiting how much gravy he's able to get at at a time via this roller mechanism."

It's the mirin, plus using a bit less sugar because my husband prefers not-as-sweet teriyaki sauces.<br />For quick meals at home, I just mix the ingredients in a measuring cup, and stir them directly in my wok without making a glossy sauce out of it. For grilling, I cook the sauce and thicken it with corn starch mixed into a couple tablespoons of mirin. We also use mirin for our rice balls to add a little flavor to the rice. This is a nice inexpensive choice for mirin and adds a good flavor. Like vinegar, soy sauce and Worcestershire sauce, it's a staple in my kitchen for homecooked meals."

Steel cut oatmeal is not for everyone, including those in my family who are fans of Cream of Wheat. But for those who like to have something with texture, McCann's is excellent: nutty, slightly chewy, and filling enough for a real breakfast that will carry one through to lunch.<br /><br />The cooking time is longer than more processed oats, but those are, well, processed, lacking the nutrition, texture, and flavor of steel cut oats. Others have posted their favorite cooking methods, so one can see that there are several ways to make this faster. I make up a whole batch, which makes four cups, eat one serving fresh and store the rest in the frig. All it takes is 90 seconds in the microwave with a little soy milk, or whatever you prefer, and it's hot and creamy for the fastest breakfast. Great with no sweetener or with one's favorite (brown sugar, real maple syrup, artificial sweetener, honey), with fruit and nuts, with cream, milk, soymilk (in my case), or nothing. It'll stand up to just about anything or, for purists, on its own.<br /><br />I have an Amazon subscription for McCann's steel cut oats, so I've gotten many, many cans of it over the years. A few of them (out of dozens of cans) might have been slightly dented, as a couple of reviewers noted, but only very slightly dented, not more than one might find in the grocery store. The can is solid and has a sealed inner lining, which has always been intact. I've never had one taste stale, as one reviewer mentioned, and I've stocked up on the stuff and had it around for many months.

Simply comparing the nutrition facts with any regular peanut butter immediately shows you the extreme difference in fat.  I know, I know, fat from nuts is supposedly ""good fat,"" but you still don't want too much of any type of fat in your diet.  PB2 essentially gets rid of the fat you don't need.  As I understand it, the peanuts are crushed down and the oil is soaked out of them.  Then, the remaining powdered peanuts are packaged up with a ""seasoning"" of salt and sugar (the ONLY other 2 ingredients in it) and you have PB2!<br /><br />To reconstitute it, all you do is add 1 tablespoon of water to 2 tablespoons of the powdered PB2 and mix until you have peanut-butter-consistency.  It really does taste just like peanut butter.  Even my husband liked it, and he's not afraid to say something tastes nasty when it's trying to be healthy.  He loved the taste and was even happier afterwards when I showed him the back of the bottle compared to our regular peanut butter bottle.  This is especially great for any baking recipes that call for peanut butter b/c we all know how difficult it can be to make those cookies and other sweet things ""healthy."""

But this really surprised me. There was none. No taste. Just tan water.  When I put the packet into the pod brewer, what came out was not coffee. I couldn't believe it. Not from Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee. No way, mon.  I didn't name my dog Stanley Marley for nothing.  I'm a believer.  I took another pod, cut it open and poured the contents into a K-cup and gave the Keurig Brewer a try. What a difference.  The fragrance was enough to bring me to my knees.  The taste?  You know how coffee is supposed to taste but mostly doesn't?  That's how it tastes.  Rich, deep coffee notes, almost a smokiness, but not heavy...this is a lively brew.  There is a definite that makes you want to gulp the whole cup. But sip it...it's too good to gulp.<br /><br />After that first experiment, I opened 3 more pods and poured the contents into the Boodum.  Not the right grind, so I ended up with tons of grounds in the cup but the flavor? Even better.  That rich coffee taste with absolutely no bitterness, no sour aftertaste. I had the Keurig version black, and tasted the Boodum mug first with nothing, then with regular milk, and then poured a cup and added one scant tablespoon of condensed milk.  All of them were wonderful.  Of course I did not sleep for 3 days, but you have to make sacrifices for the sake of science.<br /><br />I wholeheartedly recommend the coffee, but not the carrier. Don't order the pods, order the whole bean or ground, loose coffee.  This is an excellent brew when it is released from Pod Prison. It has that beautiful deep, almost turkish coffee flavor going for it.  Black it revs you up, but with milk, cream or condensed milk, it is pure sipping pleasure.  This is Sunday morning, sit back, read the newspaper, put your feet up, life is wonderful coffee.  No fooling.<br /><br />And just for the record, one of the reviewers who gave this product a single star felt that it was bitter and too strong.  I don't know what sort of weak-kneed coffee set that standard, but if you are using the pod, there is no way this could be too strong.  The same reviewer also added ""flavored coffee creamer"" to the cup.  That stuff is just awful. The 'flavors' are crude and artificial and probably made from petroleum byproducts, recycled plastic bags and zoo waste.  Add real cream, no problem. Add flavors...real cinnamon, cardamom, a little red pepper even.  Nutmeg brings out the inner soul of most coffee, it's lovely. If it's a spice and smells like dessert, it will work.  You can melt a cube of dark chocolate in the microwave and stir it in. Even better, smoosh up a Peppermint Patty and pour the coffee over that. Chocolaty, pepperminty goodness that is like Christmas in a cup.  Flavor your coffee any way you like, but not the fake stuff.  But with this coffee, you don't need to monkey around.  It's that good. Just nix the pod."

Don't get me wrong, it isn't nasty, but in comparison to Coombs or Highlands it is terrible.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I feel like I wasted $36 on maple syrup, as I now have about 60 oz. of Hidden Springs Maple Syrup that I won't eat.

I took a bit of a haitus because I became an adult (sort of), and because the Bonomos stopped making it. But I never forgot the wonderful flavors and consistency of the taffy; my favorite was the bananna.<br /><br />So imagine my surprise when I saw Turkish Taffy for sale at our local County Fair last week! It was for sale for $1.59 almost 32X more expensive than it was thirty five years ago. But the flavor is right on (bananna and vanilla), and the consistency is excellent. I was able to break it up into nice pieces at room temperature with a few well placed whacks! The secret is to hit it several times at different places along the length of the bar against a hard, rounded or ""blunt"" object, such as the edge of a curb or a stair railing. Don't smack it against a flat surface. I was willing to overlook the incredible inflated price (Note; its cheaper here on Amazon - $1/bar if you get a 24-count box) and I enjoyed several bars.<br /><br />The only thing spoiling a very nice effort by the folks currently distributing the product is that the wrapper is all wrong. Either they didn't bother to do their reserach, or more likley, they are hoping we will overlook what is probably a large cost savings and manufacturing efficiency. Today's product is wrapped in a plastic sleeve that has a seam running down the back and is sealed on both ends. As millions of people my age know, this kind of wrapper makes it very difficult to get at the chunks, particularly the small ones, that you have just created inside the covering.<br /><br />The old wrapper was foil with the color matching the flavor on the outside (yellow for bananna, etc.), and silver metallic color on the inside. The metallic wrapper could be gently unfolded first on the ends, and then along the middle to expose 100% of the marvelous, freshly broken taffy...and then folded back up and stuffed into your pocket!! Very important for those quick getaways on your bike. (That might have had a bananna seat...)<br /><br />EXPLANATION OF STARS AWARDED:<br />**** for the effort to reintroduce Turkish Taffy + * for nice flavor - * for lousy wrapper + * for outstanding breakability = ***** Basically, the product quality trumps the lousy wrapper in my opinion, although I discovered its not a good idea to stuff a half-eaten bar wrapped in cheap plastic into your suitcoat pocket. So if you're listening Bonomo People, please bring back the foil wrapper. With the 20X price increase (based on Amazon's price for a box), there's got to be a little profit margin in there for the original, authentic foil. Really."

I bought it at my grocery store, in the organic section. I didn't know what to expect. It is green and the size of the particles varies greatly. Some of it is actually a powder, and it sometimes seeps out of the infuser as you're brewing it. There are pieces of stem and the leaves are not cut to a uniform size.<br /><br />When you brew it, you need an infuser with a very fine mesh, and you can't submerge the infuser since stuff will leak out where it closes. You want a cylindrical infuser that opens at the top, and make sure the top of the infuser is not submerged. Don't try one of those round ones that closes like 2 halves of an egg, unless you want particles in your drink. There are special gourd things you're supposed to use, but I haven't tried those.<br /><br />Find a good place to let the infuser drain. It will leave a dark green stain on whatever it sits on while it drains. This stain will probably wash out, but you need to watch out for it. If you spill any of the powdery particles of th dry mix, and then if they get wet, they will make the same kind of stain.<br /><br />Having said all of this, I liked the taste and I used up two 16 oz. packages of this in just a short while.

It is actually a bit more pleasant than a few other brands when consumed alone. When a serving is added to some hemp oil, almond milk and fruits, it falls into balance and the nuttiness of the hemp stands out nicely. The grittiness also becomes unnoticeable in my smoothies - and I'm using an inexpensive blender. I've also started making nutrition bars with this stuff and so far so good. I've seen a huge debate here and elsewhere about the quality of hemp protein. I am privileged enough to choose a diet that makes me feel good and remain healthy. Since this is not my sole source of protein, I'm not concerned that I will get Kwashiorkor, in case anyone still feels like maintaining the potential negative of switching to a hemp protein only diet.

I asked the vet, and she said it's true, but she wouldn't say it's common.  She said to go with chicken and save the lamb and bison as alternatives IF she would become allergic.  So then WC became my #1 choice.  It's grain free which I liked.  So we picked up the food, picked up our new puppy and started the half and half with the dog food the breeder was giving.  After all the research I almost cried as I poured in the ""other brand"" (knowing how bad all the fillers/corn/garbage was in the other stuff).  So we only went two days with the mixing, then I went to straight WCore.  She did great (7 and half weeks at this point)!  Never had any digestion problems, never had any loose stools.  I am hoping for the miracle food that everyone is claiming that it will produce much better fur and low dander.  We've bathed her 3 times in one week (I know, a bit compulsive) and she has no skin problems.  She is a little over 8 lbs. now, and just moved up to about a cup a day.  So they do eat less than the typical dog food.  The ""other brand"" was recommending almost 2 cups while WC was right on track with what she was eating at 1 cup/ day (divided into thirds or fourths throughout the day).  So I feel a little better spending the extra money knowing that it's lasting me longer than the typical bag of ""other brand"" dog food.  Love that the ingredients are healthy!  The only hangup I had was a comment I had read that their dog didn't like it.  I wasn't spending sixty dollars to find out she didn't like it.

The tea (the leaves as well as the tea itself) has to look good, smell good, and overall present itself as something of great refinement.  No Japanese would offer another person tea that was less than wonderful, except maybe at the office.<br /><br />If the eyes are the window to the soul for Americans, the tea a person serves is the window to the soul of Japanese people.<br /><br />So my real expectation was that my wife would open up the canister, maybe try some herself once, and it just wouldn't pass enough to serve to anyone else.  Wow, was I wrong.<br /><br />She opened it up with her friend, who is also from Japan, with the disclaimer that I got it from Amazon.  Clever Japanese strategy.  If it was coffee, I'd be offended as coffee is my thing, but tea is alright.<br /><br />They loved it right away.  They said, ""Come here.  Smell this.  It's a wonderful aroma.""  They added a few obligatory potential criticisms like, ""This isn't from Japan I suppose.""  And then they drank it.<br /><br />You have to understand, these two ladies drink nothing but the best.

I'm getting ready to purchase my 3rd one in as many months. It has a delicious yet subtle coconut flavor and is now one of only 3 oils I use in my cooking (+olive oil, avocado oil).<br /><br />My uses:<br />-Replace butter/fat/oil for non-stick cooking - except when using olive or avocado oil, this is my go to. In the skillet before eggs/bacon/pancakes/etc.<br />-On toast/pancakes etc. as a butter replacement - that little hint of coconut is delicious and the fattiness is reminiscent of butter.<br />-A tablespoon in my smoothies (for the health benefits)<br />-Oil replacement in baking recipes - it works just as well and is healthier!<br /><br />It's important to note that in cooking, the coconut flavor does not persist. If I add it raw I get that flavor but my eggs/bacon, for example, do not have coconut flavor after being cooked in this oil.<br /><br />HEALTHY: Read up on all the health benefits but here's the main one: yes this is a saturated fat. However, it's made up of medium-chain fatty acids. This type of fat is readily converted to energy and rarely stored as fat. Research shows that coconut oil (in moderation, of course) helps you lose weight and speeds up your metabolism.

I decided on the Ghost Pepper hot sauce because it has good review and free shipping from Amazon. I received the shipment very fast, it almost feel like next day although I certainly did not pay for that option. I tried the hot sauce in a stew I made by just putting a couple of drops in my bowl. It's got good heat like the original, but I find the flavor lacking a little. It's got a different flavor that reminds me of a Louisiana style hot sauce, but not quite as tangy.

Daisy, my neighbor's border collie, went ""absolutely ape"" for it, in the words of her owner. I saw this myself; the dog would ""walk"" for twenty feet if you held the treat up just out of her reach and started walking away. My girlfriend's dachshund Monkey had a similar reaction. Monkey would snatch up the treat and run into the next room away from everyone else, and scarf it down in the corner. The treats were a bit large for her to swallow whole (about the size of Kennedy half-dollars and about half an inch thick), so I started breaking them up for her so she wouldn't choke in her enthusiasm.<br /><br />Speaking of breaking them up, they become very crumbly, so make sure you either break them over the counter or be prepared to sweep.<br /><br />The crumbs actually worked to my advantage with my girlfriend's cat Cleo. She would not eat the treat by itself, even when broken up. However, when I broke it up in her food, she ate it, though she gave no indication that it was any different from her normal food.<br /><br />The Raw Boost Bites package get bonus points for being irresistible to canines and having healthy ingredients. Since it's advertised as a cat treat as well, I can't give it five stars since Cleo was apathetic toward it, but I know what I'm buying the dogs from now on."

My hair gets oily in about 3 days. I try to not wash more than every 3, to not dry out my hair on the ends. This means I do get some dandruff.<br /><br />I loved the scent and design of the bottle. It was smooth and thick, which I like in conditioner. I need it because while I have thick hair, the individual hairs are very fine and when not using conditioner, I have awful tangles and flyaway hair. The shampoo alone did a nice job, but it left my hair a little lacking after rinsing. If I hadn't had a conditioner, I sure would have needed one. I used it mainly on the ends, trying to avoid my scalp.<br /><br />After air drying, my hair was shiny and silky. However in a day, I noticed more oil than normal on my scalp and hair near my roots. In 2 days, I found myself needing to wash my hair, when typically I can do another day. So while it might have made my hair feel good immediately after the wash and condition, it wasn't a good fit for me on a regular basis.<br /><br />I am now trying to use it without the shampoo to see if this makes any difference."

If for some reason the zipper on your bag doesn't work then use a tie from a loaf of bread or something similar to keep the package closed.<br /><br />Moreover, Amazon correctly notes that these raisins are delicious with yogurt and cereal. They can be used in salads and numerous other recipes, too. I add them to hot oatmeal in the morning to give the otherwise bland oatmeal a natural sweetness that wakes up my taste buds big time! SMILES<br /><br />Unfortunately, raisins contain few vitamins and they do contain some carbohydrates. Amazon also notes that these raisins ""may contain an occasional grape stem or wood piece.""

I wish they contained vitamins; this disappoints me so I will take off one star to make this a four star review.<br /><br />Overall, however, Sun Maid raisins provide us with a healthy alternative to candy bars and junk food when we need that snack or burst of sugar energy.

He's never like doggy treats, bones etc. and prefers human food/meat to anything for dogs. Since I've read dry food is best for dogs we feed him dry but again, he eats when hungry but doesn't lick his chops. Cesar is the best dog food I've found to add to the dry for taste. We get at least 4 feedings from one container, which make it pretty cheap. We simply mix a spoonful into the dry food for flavor and he's got the best of both worlds. If I could find a dry food tasty enough to be served solo, I would buy it but he eats such a small amount of food I don't mind making it tasty."

Despite the strange smell, I still tried a few bites, and the taste wasn't too bad but I KNOW it would have been better without that lingering smell.<br /><br />Just like the others who have complained, the expiration date on my bag is August 29, 2012, so the product should have still been good.<br /><br />Also, like others, I felt that there really weren't many clusters as the picture on the product shows. The lack of larger clusters makes it harder to be a hand snack but you can still pour it in a cereal bowl and add milk.<br /><br />Previously I have enjoyed Kind products, so this experience won't prevent me from trying other Kind products.

We all have well water as our supply.<br /><br />This is a 1.5 bottle of water, which is a nice size. I drank it in one day and within that day I did get sick. I did not think it was the water until I read what alkaline water can do to you. I read, can't claim it, but read that the alkaline detoxes your body and neutralizes the acid in your stomach. We need acid in our stomach to process the food we eat. I read a lot of people that got sick drinking alkaline water, it might be a small percentage but I was one of them. Supposedly over time after it `cleanses' out yours system, you will feel better. With one bottle and getting sick, I cannot say that.<br /><br />It did taste good but not great. I could taste an aftertaste that was metallic like and it just did not seem crisp to me. I did finish the whole bottle, again in one day, but sadly would not buy this or drink this again if given a few more.<br /><br />The fact that it has so many additives, good or not, but yet no claims can be made or studies have been done to prove the benefits, I am leery.<br /><br />Yes it was good, not great, but getting so sick on the day I drank it and reading others that went through the same thing online is enough to keep me away."

In fact, I cannot remember a day of my life without at least one hot cup of tea...

Its fairly recent appearance on supermaket shelves has saved me from frequent trips to a not-so-local tea boutique. The Black Prearl is en excellent choice for those who, like myself, enjoy the brew without the addition of taste masking ingredients, such as lemon, sugar, or milk.<br /><br />The leaves are large (tea dust in the bag is an indicatour of inferiour quality). They brew a liquid that is golden in color (make sure your tea cup is white to enable you to admire it), strong but sweet in taste (unlike most Lipton brands that brew too dark and bitter for my liking), and an aroma that is true to the taste (be patient and allow it to develop; too short a brew=no aroma; too long=bitter taste).<br /><br />The Black Pearl presentation, a fabric piramid, is an added bonus, especially if you are brewing directly in a cup, or a transparent tea pot. My suggestion is to always use a tea pot as it lengthens the experience and allows for a better water to leaf ratio manipulation (quick tip regarding water: OVERboiling removes oxygen and prevents the maximization of flavour!).<br /><br />Sip and enjoy!<br /><br />PS: The price I have paid for this product on Amazon thru Subscribe and Save is HALF of what the supermarket charges!

Being one of those not-so-lucky folks who have blood sugar issues, I've been told that soy is a good way of getting one's protein, and when I saw this at the big warehouse store I decided to give it a try. I like the almonds and cranberries the best (although those do have sugar so I take it easy), and yes the soy nuts are not so flavorful and might not appeal to all. I see mention in another review about the pumpkin seeds coming from China, a valid concern, but I've been snacking on these for a few weeks and haven't seen any ill effects yet :)<br /><br />In the end, it is all about choice - and there are plenty of trail mixes and nut mixes out there packed with sodium.

489790,489791,B0001N485Y,AQZJBVSPWR2LF,Ravenova,8,8,5,1158710400,The Tea of Aristocrats,"Having recently been persuaded by several of my closest friends to try a beverage other than coffee, I decided to experiment with several different tea flavors. Although I tired many flavors, I discovered Earl Grey to be among my most prized favorites. This elegant tea dose not boast a subtle flavor, rather, it has many very noticeable and expertly blended flavors that demand to be noticed. Overall, there is a definitive taste inherent in most regular teas but underneath this strong and invigorating flavor there is a more subtly interwoven element of citrus and perhaps a smoky flavor as well. Because of these complementary tastes and the overall flavor they combine to make, I found this tea to be most satisfactory. It should be savored, steaming in a cherished red mug, while sitting beside a roaring fireplace with a cozy kitten snoring in a basket, the picture of utter feline contentment rolling off her in warm luxurious enveloping waves, while you indulge in a favorite book as you curl beneath the old family quilt as layers of snow cascade from the sky outside in the frigid night air. It is the quintessential tea for the most cozy of occasions and should be savored to the last drop.<br /><br />A NOTE ON BREWING : Because of the strong and sometimes bitter nature of this tea, it should not suffer over brewing! I find that it is best brewed for about two minutes; however, others with a preference for stronger tea might hazard three minutes brewing. If you wish to make it even stronger, I recommend brewing it for a greater amount of time for each individual cup until you encounter the perfect combination. Also, you will note that even the tea bags smell divine and are almost irresistible themselves.<br /><br />- Ravenova"

This bag of basmati rice was packaged well, packed well for shipping, and shipped promptly.  But the rice itself is very disappointing.  It's instant rice, and not very good instant rice at that, with a basmati flavor.  It cooks in ten minutes to a mushy pasty individual grain.<br />  What with having ten pounds of it, I've tried cooking it every way that rice can be cooked, just in case I was preparing it incorrectly. Nope, tastes like someone made rice mush and then extruded it thru small holes and re-dried it. My family and I enjoy whole grain rices that generally take 55 minutes to cook and allow you to have a pleasant flavor and distinct individual grain texture to the mouth. I even tried using it as a filler for meat loaf or meat balls. It decreases the quality of any recipe you use it in.<br />  The only explanation for all these rave reviews that I can see is that they're generated by the company, or that the purchasers have never tasted real rice before.  This stuff is awful.  After a year of holding it in my refrigerator, much to long to get a refund, I've just finished dumping 9 1/2 pounds of it in the trash."

The rest of the can is a somewhat viscous milky fluid. This ""lite"" version has none of the solid fat. It is all the milky fluid. Presumably it has FAR less fat.<br /><br />Ingredients listed are ""water, coconut milk, guar gum"". I'd rather there were no guar gum but please note the manufacturer has refrained from adding sodium metabisulfite. Some other brands of coconut products add that in order to keep the product white. But Google it. Sources claim that sodium metabisulfite is actually poisonous. I'm not a chemist but prefer my coconut milk unadulterated and thank this company for giving us a relatively pure product.<br /><br />I recently made a dish, I think it is a pudding kind of thing, using this lite version. I cooked a cup of well-washed millet in 3 cups of lightly salted water for 40 minutes, removed from heat and immediately folded in a half cup of confectioners sugar, a third of a cup of almond meal, a whole can of this lite coconut milk and a half teaspoon of cinnamon. Stirred it well. It tastes good (to me) warm or cold and I can really taste the coconut flavor. I like a dish of it topped with dried sweetened cranberries and a dollop of whipped cream (sinful and so easy from the spray can)."

As the prices have risen over the past few years, we have cut back and use it probably half as much as before. Unfortunately, it is not the coffee but the packaging that costs so much more.<br /><br />Now that prices for many K-cups have risen to close to a dollar apiece, I was extremely pleased to see that someone has begun to offer a more economical and eco-friendly cup for the Keurig. I ordered a 36-pack of the Rainforest Blend to try it out at about .40 per cup - a reasonable price, in my opinion. The coffee is delicious (I will review the coffee itself after sampling some more) and the cups work without issue. In fact, I hope to hell Green Mountain licenses these guys' design to cut the costs of their products (maybe then I will start buying theirs again.)<br /><br />An added benefit is that it is MUCH easier to open the cup and efficiently remove the grounds for composting, before trashing the remains. I would guess I could fit the remains of 1,000 of these cups in the same garbage bag space as 100 of the conventional K-cups. Do yourself (and the world) a favor and start composting now."

Caplan,2,2,5,1343433600,One of the best vanillas you will taste and at a great price,"I discovered Orlando Vanilla a few years ago while spending a week in Puerto Vallarta. I am a chef and specialize in pastries so a good vanilla is important. I've tried Nielsen Massey vanillas and they are excellent but they still have a bit of a chemical/alcohol scent to them. McCormick extract (the most commonly found at your local supermarket) is so strong alcohol-wise that once you've had good vanilla you'll never go back to cheap chemical tasting junk.<br /><br />Orlando vanilla (and their other brand La Reyna) is strong, smells sweet with no chemical notes.  The aroma of vanilla permeates the kitchen when you use it. It is very reasonably priced and since most recipes call for about a teaspoon of vanilla you will find that an eight ounce bottle like this gives you enough for 48 typical recipes. Depending on your taste or the strength you are looking for you might get fewer or more portions.<br /><br />I buy mine from Puerto Vallarta when I go. I usually buy two liters (a liter is a bit more than a quart) and this year I have a tour of the factory scheduled. Kept in a cool, dark place vanilla extract has an extremely long shelf life so no need to worry about spoilage. I don't think you can go wrong using this extract. The only other way to get better flavor is to use good quality vanilla pods (see my review on those if you are interested)"

There are many ""stories"" about the amazing benefits of these berries, many of which may be true, but a few verifiable facts about them (in dried form) follow:<br /><br />1) High protein (about 12%), and are a complete protein. This is good for anybody, but particularly noteworthy to vegans, who choose not to get their protein from meats.<br /><br />2) Decent fiber content (about 10%)<br /><br />3) 18 (!!) amino acids<br /><br />4) Like most sweet fruits, high in carbs and calories. 100 grams give you about 350-380 calories; roughly 3/4 from carbs and 1/4 from fat.<br /><br />5) 6 vitamins, 8 amino acids, 11+ minerals (more in trace amounts)<br /><br />6) Carotenoids, unsaturated fatty acids (this is a good thing), phytosterols (help lower cholesterol), and other healthy (or theoretically healthy but not particularly well researched) phytochemicals.<br /><br />Enough with the technical jargon. These berries are great in cereal, smoothies (once hydrated), and tea. For tea, try this:<br /><br />Put water, a small number of berries (6-15ish) and a teabag in your cup, microwave for about a minute per teacup (time varies), drop a small amount in your favorite tea along with the teabag and let the berries and tea steep for about 3 minutes.<br /><br />This adds a subtle character to green tea (plus an unusual, tasty snack to do with a few of the sips). The flavor seems to blend well with chai and jasmine too. This may work differently for those who use creamer.<br /><br />I recommend that you try a bag, keeping in mind that you may need to soak the berries in water/tea/whatever in order to make them soft, and see what you think. I have found they make a great addition to my usual cereal-only breakfast because they give me a much-needed protein boost.<br /><br />If you like them quite a lot, you may want to take the time to look for a supply in a nearby Asian foods store. I have heard they can be purchased at a lower cost in bulk."

Some folks in my family think it is salty. Sometimes before I pop a pack, I pour the packet into a paper plate and remove some of the salt.  by separating the kernels from the salt mixture. Then I pour the kernels back into the packet and wait for the popcorn machine."

Nonetheless, RC is outstanding, far superior to Coke and Pepsi, and is deserving of your purchase."

But we wanted a tea everyone could enjoy, not just the grownups. I bought a sampler pack of all the zingers, and we did a family taste test. Tangerine Zinger won every round!<br /><br />Now we make a crock of tea once a week or so. We experimented to find the method that makes the best flavor and here's what we do: Boil a kettle of water. Put 10 bags (half a box) in the crock. Pour the hot water in and let the bags steep an hour or overnight. Take the bags out, fill the rest of the crock up with water, and put in the fridge to cool.<br /><br />This is such a great alternative to sodas and black tea. Whenever we offer iced tea people say no until we tell them it's herbal, then the compliments start. It's great to see kids helping themselves, and it's so refreshing! Costs us about $1.50 per week."

I tried Red Bull, Nos, Amp, Rockstar, and tons of other varieties, but it wasn't until I found Rockstar Zero Carb that I discovered one I really liked. I normally hate things that are ambiguously flavoured ""wild berry"" or something similar, and I don't usually enjoy diet beverages. Rockstar Zero Carb is the exception to this rule. I'm in my 20s now, and I don't drink energy drinks every day, but when I do drink them, this is the kind I prefer.<br /><br />As a side note - this packs in a lot more ""energy"" ingredients than most energy drinks, and I've always felt that I absorb them better without the carbs. And if for some reason you have no sense of self-preservation and drink four or even five of these beasts in a single night, you don't have to worry about all the awful sugar you'd get in the non-sugarfree version."

The apple is very pronounced and crisp.  Very refreshing drink.<br /><br />I think it has a much stronger flavor than some of the other Crystal Lights that I have tried.<br /><br />The only thing keeping it from getting 5 stars is I found it tasted its' best when icy cold.  Once it started warming up, the taste wasn't as sharp, and adding too many ice cubes to keep cold watered it down quickly.<br /><br />This is one Crystal Light I would buy again."

Being the first Organic licorice i will order, i was not sure if it would be different from the licorice i was used to or not. As far as i could tell there was no difference. It has the nice chewy texture that makes licorice unique. The flavour is also quite good.Being organic means it should be a healthier option too. I gave it 4 stars because my children don't like it. They took a taste and stayed off the entire pack. So i guess my kids must have noticed a difference but they could not explain to me what the difference was.So, while i consider it good for adults, note that buying it for children might not work."

It's not really fair to compare it to a $120 premium kit. With that said, I found it to be a solid product with nice flavor.<br /><br />Based on other reviews on Amazon and forums I knew that I shouldn't make this kit to the full 6 gallons or it would be weak and lack body. I only made it to 5 gallons, but I would recommend you make it based on specific gravity rather than volume, because mine came out a little strong. Mine came out to about 13% ABV. On a Cabernet or a more full-bodied wine that would be okay, but it's a little strong for a Riesling. They give you the recommended starting SG, so I would shoot for the middle of that, rather than filling to volume, but probably about 5 1/2 gallons is where you want to be. That will allow you to leave the sediment behind and still fill up a 5 gallon carboy. If you have left over, then keep it in a one gallon jug/carboy and use to top up later in the process.<br /><br />The flavor is still excellent and very drinkable. It was a dry kit, so I sweetened with 1 1/4 cups of wine conditioner. I added a little sorbate after clarifying and before adding the sweetner to avoid fermentation kicking off again. Give it a few days between adding the sorbate and sweetening to make sure fermentation is completely killed off. It's still not very sweet, so I would recommend 1 1/2 cups conditioner/sweetner to get closer to a Washington style Riesling.<br /><br />Overall I think the kit is a true bargain, especially with free super saver shipping. I've since ordered the Shiraz and so far it is exceeding expectations as well."
